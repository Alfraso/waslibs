    "Description": "Picture perfect With its stunning 4K UHD display, the Dell XPS 15 eclipses the view of all other 15-inch laptops. It features the world's first InfinityEdge display, a virtually borderless 15.6-inch screen placed into the body of an 14-inch laptop. Plus, the XPS 15 is only 11-17mm thin and weighs 4.5 pounds, making it the lightest performance-class 15-inch laptop on the market today. And with Windows 10, you get easy ways to snap apps in place, create new desktops, and work and play across all your devices. Crystal-clear display. The XPS 15 delivers an incredible 8 million pixels on its 4K Ultra HD display—that's 4 million more pixels than Full HD. What you get is a view that's always precise, clear, and eye-poppingly lifelike. Movies jump off the screen. Presentations shine. And photos and videos can be edited with pinpoint precision. Solid as a rock Premium craftsmanship and design make this laptop a real head-turner. Its all-aluminum body is strong, durable, and stylish, while its carbon-fiber base is tough and thin like aluminum but cooler to the touch. And with a Corning Gorilla Glass NBT display, you get enhanced scratch resistance, reduced scratch visibility, and better retained strength once a scratch occurs.",
