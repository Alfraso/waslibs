        <title>The Adventure Continues -  ECPAT</title>
        <content type="html">
            &lt;p&gt;My initial research into ECPAT… To be completely honest, I thought they were but a wishy-washy (but well-funded) organisation with a nice website. One that concerned itself with changing policy from the comforts of our lofty first-world country, rather than rescuing the children firsthand. But oh how my prejudices were proven wrong! &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So one of the projects I’d initially scoffed at was the Internet Digital Filtering project (in partnership with all the big internet service providers who, in combination, provides at least 95% of New Zealand’s internet traffic). Basically, internet users can report sites with child pornography using an app, and that person’s internet service provider will send a report to the central database and block that website amongst all partnering service providers. This means that at least 95% of New Zealand’s internet won’t be able to access it, which translates to less revenue for the abusers. (Since traffic is the way these websites make money)
            In short, less site traffic = less revenue = less incentive to for the abusers to sexually abuse children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECPAT’s education efforts; again, cynical me from the past dismissed it as little more than one person’s shouting at a football game on television - that is, having little to no effect on the intended recipients (the football team or sexually abused children), and serving only to provide a sense of accomplishment for oneself. But no sooner had I stepped into their offices had Alan proven me wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the STOP Trust, 1 in 8 New Zealanders have experienced sexual abuse as a child. ECPAT’s education efforts, then, teach people that this kind of behaviour is unacceptable. This means that New Zealanders as a whole will be more likely to speak up against child sex abuse, and less likely to become abusers in the future.
            Side note, Kiwi involvement in child internet sex tourism (sadly, that is a thing) was uncovered in an undercover sting operation in the Netherlands sometime late last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hence, educating the public and drying up the producers’ revenue stream is the way to go, because while charging into a Vietnam, guns ablaze and breaking out child sex slaves sounds far more satisfying satisfying, if their environment and the people surrounding these children don’t change, abusers will just find the next gullible family willing to give up their daughter for 10 dollars. (Which, I might add, isn’t particularly difficult given a combination of desperation and ignorance) &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;What’s more, ECPAT has maintained all of this (that is, their website, their education efforts, everything) from a modest office space little bigger than an average family’s kitchen. (Their space also happens to be above the Charlotte Museum for lesbian artifacts. So before entering their office space, you’ll see posters with two naked women, saying things like ‘save water, shower together.’) &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hence, if one was to summarize ECPAT in a word, without a doubt that world would be 'efficiency’. From their allocation of resources to their time management, it was clear from the very first email (that is, before Imo, Angel and I had so much as stepped foot in their office,) that they weren’t ones to mess around with.
            To demonstrate their efficiency, may I present..
            Exhibit A.
            The day before our meeting with ECPAT’s Alan Bell, I’d emailed him in the evening outlining a few talking points for the next day’s video. Within the hour (at 7pm on a Monday, no less) he had sent me a reply, accommodating each of my (terrorist) demands (I kid, I kid), and complete with a script he’d worked up in response to the talking points. A SCRIPT! &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Exhibit B.
            The entirety of what you’d call 'ECPAT employees’ consist, currently, of Alan and Ling. Looking at their website and all the work they’ve done in their efforts to eradicate child sex exploitation; from the ECPAT Child Alert to all their education efforts, I’d never have believed, prior to stepping foot into their office, that everything you see online is currently maintained by two people.
            So the next time somebody cynically proclaims charities take donations to line their own pockets (and quite depressingly, it’s not the first time somebody’s said this to me), he or she will be forcibly dragged along to ECPAT’s office space for a dose of reality. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Exhibit C.
            I’d emailed Alan a few weeks prior to our meeting indicating it would be about an hour, 1.5 hours max. And lo and behold - we arrived at 10:30 and were out the door at 12:00 sharp, without ever feeling rushed or like there was more to be done. Some people tend to chit-chat, but Alan’s presence, I thought, was no bullshit, though always steering clear of sounding brusque or impatient. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Also, something I’d recalled from the meeting that really resonated with me. (And it just so happened to be the only part I didn’t record, so bear with me on any factual inaccuracies.)
            Speaking with Alan, he’d mentioned his background working in the Third Sector for decades; from working in Third World countries on community development projects to settling down at ECPAT a few years ago.
            I should preface this by saying that people often speak of charity work as 'giving back’ to the community. To Alan, that simply wasn’t the case.
            “In all my years,’ he said, 'I’m quite convinced I’ve gotten more out of it than I’ve ever given back.” &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;And that, I think, is what sucks me into charity work; there are so many intangible but real, nebulous but noticeable things you get out of just doing it that, in truth, it becomes rather addictive. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The adventure begins - TradeAid</title>
        <content type="html">
            &lt;p&gt;So over a month ago, back when every store was preemptively promoting their Valentine’s Day merchandise, I arranged a day for Imo, Jahn, Anton and I to scurry along to Trade Aid’s Newmarket and High Street stores. Raewyn was lovely enough to meet us as our ‘tour guide,’ and with that agreement, armed with our bags full of questions and recording equipment, our little story begins here… &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;'Vi had always said’, Raewyn tells us, 'whatever decisions we make as a business, we have to always think about our producers; they have to always be at the heart of the decisions we make.’
            Vi Cottrell, along with her husband Richard, co-founded Trade Aid in the 70s. Their dedication to improving the lives of their underprivileged producer groups has carried Trade Aid through to today.
            Fair Trade, for them, means paying their producers fairly and consistently, which allows room for future planning (should they need a new school, a well, etc.), skills improvement, business growth, and to generally lift themselves out of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;One of the things that really stuck out to me through my conversation with Raewyn was that it’s not a marketing strategy for these people. Empowering and improving the lives of their producers in underprivileged communities through Fair Trade practices is the reason Trade Aid exists. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I mean, Starbucks can put up a great big sign on the window advertising their “Fair Trade” coffee, but their goal, ultimately, is to line their investors’ pockets. For Trade Aid though, the point isn’t to profit from a Fair Trade sign, but to actually help their producers out of extreme poverty by working with them to develop new skills and products, as well as make sure the communities’ work and efforts are compensated by fair wages, allowing for growth and improved living standards. And because Trade Aid is a non-profit, they can focus solely on this mission, going as far as to share their profits (known as 'rebates’) with their producers. The producers themselves can, as a community, choose to use the money how they see fit, be that on some warm clothes for the winter or a development project. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;So as Raewyn spoke to us about all of this, Jahn and Anton were busy setting up for Raewyn to go on camera. The process basically entailed a panic-stricken frenzy, a dash across the road, and repeated cursing at the outside traffic. Ultimately, we decided to scoot along to the High Street store, seeking shelter from the traffic noise whilst recording the audio. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It turns out that the High Street store, even more so than the Newmarket one, was a treasure trove of quirks, character and personality. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;We walked in to a wall of Indian kimonos (note: kimonos made in India, not traditional Indian kimonos, because that’s not a thing), Nepali hand puppets above Indian knitted bunnies, and an assortment of Valentine’s Day merchandise. (This made me curious as to whether the non-Western producers of these goods are familiar with the notion of 'Valentine’s Day,’ and if they are, whether they think it’s a ridiculous idea.. but I digress). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;There was Marleni from Peru, whose name, naturally, is pronounced with a rolling 'r’ like 'Marrrrrleni.’ (And who, along with Anton, ganged up on my complete inability to roll my 'r’s). There was Jean, a soft-spoken Chinese woman who’d taken up volunteering at Trade Aid to improve her English, and who, with limitless patience, rearranged the chocolate displays time after time following my clumsy assaults (those chocolates taste delicious, by the way!). There was Nola, an energetic woman in gold-rimmed spectacles who began recounting for me when the first Trade Aid store opened in Auckland. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;'On Karangahape road? Or maybe Newton road.. it’s been a while.’ &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;There was also Linda the manager, who’d been so accommodating with our efforts to (in the name of perfecting the backdrop for our video) basically rearrange half the store.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;A certain joie de vivre in their demeanor gave away their genuine excitement for volunteering their time. In fact, everybody I’d met there really believed in Trade Aid’s message; that is, flipping the traditional business paradigm of profit before people, such that putting people before profit becomes the social norm.
            And with social justice gaining popularity amongst companies and the general public alike, maybe hopefully Fair Trade practices will become the mainstream, and big corporations will be forced to change their practices to conform.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This isn’t to say everybody has to suddenly go Fair Trade or nothing, because individual circumstances and finances often stand in the way of that. Just start with one thing - like… always buy Fair Trade coffee, because no matter how limited your finances, you can always buy coffee. Just little things :)
            Or if you’re reading this before March 7th,  you can join Synergy for the opportunity to work closely with Trade Aid on our project with them! (Cheesy grin here) &lt;/p&gt;
