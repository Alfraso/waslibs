            <![CDATA[<input class="jpibfi" type="hidden" ><p>Positioned on a sweeping hillside beside the beautiful Dart estuary is the National Trust&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/greenway/">Greenway house and gardens</a>. With a long and fascinating history, this gorgeous Georgian mansion most notably played host to author Agatha Christie who declared it &#8216;the loveliest place in the world&#8217;.</p>
<p>Walking around the carefully preserved rooms, I could easily see why Christie loved it so &#8211; I was ready to move in. Avid collectors, Christie and her family filled Greenway with many objets d&#8217;art &#8211; archaeological finds, silver and botanical china, not forgetting a library laden with books. We were lucky enough to time our visit with the history talk by volunteer Ken. His knowledge about the rich and varied events in the house&#8217;s past was unparalleled and breathed life into the very walls of the building.</p>
<p>Outside, the gardens are just as enchanting. Being spring, it was a joy to see the trees and plants bursting into life, lining the paths with magnificent magnolia, camellia and rhododendron, not to mention cascading carpets of primroses, snowdrops and hellebores. As someone who is trying to up my photography skills, the gardens were the perfect excuse to try out my macro setting.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also recommended you follow the trail down the hill to the banks of the River Dart, where a beautiful boathouse sits. You won&#8217;t regret it. Once used as a murder scene in Christie&#8217;s work &#8216;Dead Man&#8217;s Folly&#8217; it’s currently being restored it to its former glory.</p>
<p>After taking in the breathtaking view from the top garden, all that was left was for us to wander back to the on-site cafe for a spot of tea and cake, or even a warmed sausage roll in my case! So delicious. Inevitably, the allure of the shop won me over, in particular the promise of taking a little Greenway&#8217;s magic home with me in the form of a rose bush named after the famed author.</p>

            <![CDATA[<input class="jpibfi" type="hidden" ><p><a href="http://www.sudeleycastle.co.uk" target="_blank">Sudeley Castle</a> is a place where the very walls are steeped in adventure and history, not to mention bloodshed; it&#8217;s replete with tales of kings, queens, intrigue and betrayal. My children were enchanted by the story of Brock, a pet badger who lived as part of the family within the castle walls.</p>
<p>In celebration of the castle&#8217;s badger connection, Sudeley has collaborated with <a href="http://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk" target="_blank">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a> to create a living willow maze, with a Wind in the Willows theme. A huge sculpted badger, a mole, and a native water vole; characters from a favourite story suddenly larger than life.</p>
<p>Alongside the castle, there is a playground in the form of a huge wooden fort: the stuff of childhood dreams. Having spent their precious pocket money on swords from the extensive wooden armoury in the gift shop, my boys whiled away the morning running through its corridors, re-enacting battles with their friends. As I sat in the sunshine and watched them, it felt as if we had escaped the present for a moment, suspended in time by some special Sudeley magic.</p>

            <![CDATA[<input class="jpibfi" type="hidden" ><p>The sunshine and daffodils were out in full force on a recent weekend visit to the National Trust’s <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/dunham-massey/" target="_blank">Dunham Massey</a>, where a current exhibition sees the property transformed back to its previous life, serving as the wartime Stamford army hospital. And we soon got more than we bargained for, when on entering the impressively restored hospital ward, live actors suddenly began acting out the stories of past patients from their beds!</p>
<p>Wandering slowly from one decadent room to another, we took in the beauty of our grand surroundings. In one room, an antique screen housed delicate butterflies, suspended in glass, mid-flight; another bedroom, awash with blood red satin and velvet. But it was the historic library which held us in awe with its lavishly bound volumes and scientific apparatus.</p>
<p>Later, we were lured across the courtyard and into the old kitchen by the smell of cinnamon as ‘servants’ baked a cake using a traditional household recipe. This soon got our tummies rumbling, and, after refuelling with a tasty lunch in the former Stables, we wandered around the tranquil gardens, where spring crocuses and snowdrops had begun to blossom amongst a carpet of sherbet lemon daffodils.</p>
<p>Our soundtrack was provided by the gentle trickle of the garden’s streams, a chorus of birdsong and the chatter of children playing in the nearby parkland. The place is a pure haven. Reluctantly, we left as the spring sun began to weaken and, passing the fortress like walls, caught site of dozens of deer grazing on the grass.</p>

            <![CDATA[<input class="jpibfi" type="hidden" ><p>I took the kids to Norfolk this month in anticipation of wide-open skies, scrummy local produce and wonderful wildlife. The Gods smiled on us and the sun shone, we scoffed fish and chips, and took a <a href="http://www.bishopsboats.com/index.html" target="_blank">seal trip</a> to Blakeney Point.</p>
<p>Roads can be slow winding through flinty villages, so we allowed plenty of time to get tickets; we were rewarded with the sight of eager youngsters crabbing quayside in front of a classic Norfolk wherry.</p>
<p>Although seals are guaranteed all year, boats generally run March-October. Shifting sands, literally, mean little Blakeney Quay will be silted up soon, so the boats cast off from Morston, further along the coast. Here, the kids gambolled through salt-marsh grasses while a skylark poured out song.</p>
<p>The boat chugged down the creek before heading out to Blakeney Point itself, past the sea-green lifeboat station built over a century ago on the edge of the spit, and now stranded up-channel by longshore drift.</p>
<p>Once at the Point, we delighted to see both Common (cream, rounded heads) and Grey (slate-coloured, Roman noses) Seals basking on the shore, swimming beside and under the boat. A hogey of Sandwich Terns performed aerial displays above and around. We had the sun and sea-spray on our faces all the way back.</p>

            <![CDATA[<input class="jpibfi" type="hidden" ><p>Heading south on the A21 on the Kent/East Sussex border, just as you enter the village of Hurst Green, you will find a most welcome pit-stop in the <a href="http://www.eggstoapples.co.uk/" target="_blank">Eggs to Apples</a> farm shop. This third generation family-run business is housed in a stunning, contemporary style barn and sells locally sourced/grown produce including catch-of-the-day fish from near-by Hastings, Rye, Eastbourne and Brighton.</p>
<p>I love everything about this farm shop. I could quite happily move into the beautiful building. Or just buy everything. The team here take really care and everything is beautifully displayed &#8211; the colours of the fresh fruit and veg stacked high, the scent of fresh bread and fresh cut flowers provide tempting diversions at every turn.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the perfect place to fill a picnic basket with freshly baked bread, cooked meats, preserves, wines and local beers before heading off further south to the coast. Or simply top up your caffeine fix in their great cafe with far-reaching views over the High Weald. It&#8217;s a hard place to leave. My pit-stops are becoming a regular thing.</p>

The latter is one of the last strongholds of the red squirrel, and the reason I decided to venture down with my boyfriend. We walked and walked through the forest with our eyes peeled, but weren&#8217;t rewarded this time. The early spring sunshine and blue skies were too rare a treat to waste, however, so we braced ourselves against the growing wind and made our way down to Formby beach.</p>
<p>Vast, hazy and rugged, the beach feels like a true wilderness. Shattered razor clams and scattered crab shells emptied by busy wading birds crunch underfoot. The sea, foamy and cool, is the perfect place to stand and peer out over the horizon, the soft <em>sss</em><em>ssh</em> of the waves calming your soul.</p>
<p>We followed winding paw prints left by excitable dogs until we found the perfect incline to clamber up onto the surrounding sand dunes: an area we&#8217;ve never fully explored. With the wind picking up, my hair whipped my face and my coat pockets filled with flying grains of sand. Our laughter grew and grew. And as we reached the top, straightened up and brushed ourselves off, we were greeted with the most breathtaking panorama &#8211; a glittering ocean, shifting sand and sweeping stretch of secretive forest.</p>
