<p><strong>Private blogs</strong> are great for when you just want your friends and family to have access to your posts, you want to run an internal company blog to share information between team members, or you're just in the pre-launch phase.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/06/privateblogui.png" alt="Private Blogs"></p>

<p>When you enable password protection for your blog all social and search engine optimisation features are disabled, and visitors must enter the password to be able view your content.</p>

<p>This is a simple implementation designed for the most common use-case of a simple restricted access blog with a shared password. <em>If you're storing highly sensitive content you should use robust security &amp; authentication!</em></p>

It’s the reason we’re here today!</p>

<p>To celebrate, we’ve got an enormous post in store for you, sharing exactly how we spent the Kickstarter money<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://blog.ghost.org/year-2/#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, where we've gotten to so far, and what's coming up next for Ghost.</p>

<h2 id="kickstarter">Kickstarter</h2>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/gh-ks.jpg" alt="Two Years in: How we Spent The Kickstarter Money, where we are now,  and what’s next for Ghost"></p>

<p>On April 29th, 2013 - Ghost <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform/">launched on Kickstarter</a> with an idea for a brand new blogging platform. Just 29 days later it had blown away its fundraising goal by more than <strong>800%</strong> and raised $300,000 in the process.</p>

<p>Today we're back to tell you <em>exactly</em> where all that money went and what we've been working on ever since. Strap yourself in!</p>

<h3 id="fundingbreakdown">Funding breakdown</h3>

<p>Here's the breakdown of funding as Kickstarter sent it to us:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/gh-ks2.jpg" alt="Two Years in: How we Spent The Kickstarter Money, where we are now,  and what’s next for Ghost"></p>

<ul>
<li>Total pledges: $296,743.12</li>
<li>Dropped pledges: $13,212.84</li>
<li>Kickstarter fees: $14,176.51</li>
<li>Payment processing fees: $10,033.70</li>
<li>Value Added Tax (VAT): $4,842.04</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total Kickstarter funds received:</strong> $254,478.03</p>

<p>After the campaign ended, we were very fortunate that <a href="https://ghost.org/about/partners/">several more</a> large companies were interested in sponsoring Ghost - and we were very pleased to welcome their support.</p>

<ul>
<li>Additional sponsorships: $60,448.00</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total funding received:</strong> $314,926.03</p>

<h3 id="startupcostbreakdown">Startup cost breakdown</h3>

<p>This is everything we spent to get Ghost up and running as a company, broken down into individual categories.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ghost.org development - $50,977.36</li>
<li>Ghost.org domain: $33,300.00</li>
<li>Servers / hardware: $30,839.58</li>
<li>Ghost(Pro) development - $19,930.53</li>
<li>Logo / identity: $10,000</li>
<li>Launch event: $9,385.79</li>
<li>Trademark: $2,501.51</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total startup costs:</strong> $156,934.77<br>
<strong>Remaining budget:</strong> $157,991.26</p>

<h3 id="runningcostbreakdown">Running cost breakdown</h3>

<p>Once we were up and running, these were our averaged out monthly expenses to keep the business running.</p>

<ul>
<li>Salaries (4 people): $18,000/month</li>
<li>Hosting: $3,042.68/month</li>
<li>Software: $534.98/month</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total monthly costs:</strong> $21,577.66</p>

<h2 id="summaryhighlights">Summary &amp; Highlights</h2>

<p>Our total startup costs came in at <strong>$156,934.77</strong> - leaving a remaining operating budget of <strong>$157,991.26</strong> to support ongoing running costs. Employing a team of 4, plus hosting and overheads came in at <strong>$21,566.66/month</strong>, meaning the remaining funding supported just over 7 months of business operation and development.</p>

<p><em>A few notes on individual items:</em></p>

<h3 id="kickstarterinefficiency">Kickstarter inefficiency</h3>

<p>As you can see, we actually paid about <strong>15%</strong> of what we raised on Kickstarter straight away to fees, dropped pledges and taxes. This is a monumental amount. We weren’t prepared for just how high this would be by any stretch of the imagination. This was a tough lesson which was only offset by the fact that we did an extra round of private sponsorships which made up the difference.</p>

<p>One of the best decisions we made was <strong>not</strong> to have any physical rewards. There are too many stories of projects who spend 3 months and 50% of their funding making tshirts and dealing with shipping problems instead of working on their project. Avoiding this pitfall was important.</p>

<p>The only exception where our rewards included something that was not the product itself, was the launch event. This was explicitly included in all rewards over $1,000 (which is to say: it was something which people deliberately backed and paid for to happen). As backers at this level made up <strong>$85,000</strong> of the total funding, the $9,300 launch event expense was easily paid for and also generated great launch PR including national media coverage.</p>

<h3 id="investinginassets">Investing in assets</h3>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/001/177/871/ccadae4f0d690de1ce2e58dc4c2934ae_large.jpg?1381819346" alt="Two Years in: How we Spent The Kickstarter Money, where we are now,  and what’s next for Ghost"></p>

<p>We spent <strong>$66,641.09</strong> on capital assets (servers, domain name and trademark). Assets are things which have and hold explicit monetary value, which is to say: You can sell them at any time and get some (or all) of your money back. So this money isn’t “gone” - it’s  simply tied up. The servers depreciate in value as they get older (they’re worth less and less), but the domain and trademark appreciate in value as the brand grows (they’re worth more and more).</p>

<p>By spending ~$30,000 on servers up front, we reduced our monthly infrastructure costs from about ~$20,000 to ~$3,000. We host <strong>16,000-20,000 full stack Node.js applications</strong> at any given time. The high resources required here are the trade-off which comes with hosting independent managed apps vs a single large multi-tenant install: You get much more freedom to allow people to write 3rd party code and run an independent site - but - the baseline cost for each of those sites is much higher.</p>

<p>The Ghost.org domain was a far more contentious matter. Owning <em>ghost.org</em> vs <em>tryghost.org</em> wouldn’t increase our income at all. If we had only received income from Kickstarter backers, who expected us to spend their hard-earned money on what we’d promised to deliver, we would have let this one go. Fortunately for us, we had additional sponsorship capital to work with following the Kickstarter campaign which gave us some added flexibility. So we decided to go for it.</p>

<p>Originally, the gentleman who owned Ghost.org wanted close to $100,000 for it. After a long negotiation we managed to get him down to <strong>$33,300</strong> and we felt that price was only ever going to go up as Ghost became bigger and more well-known.</p>

<p>It was a really hard decision to let go of such a large sum at such an early stage, but we felt that the long term investment in the brand was ultimately worth it. Looking back now and imagining what the price might be if we tried to get the domain 2 years later, we're very, very happy we did this back then.</p>

<h3 id="ghostorgghostpro">Ghost.org &amp; Ghost(Pro)</h3>

<p>We spent <strong>$70,907.89</strong> on subcontracting to build <strong>Ghost.org</strong> and <strong>Ghost(Pro)</strong>. The vast majority of this went to our friends at <a href="https://atechmedia.com/">aTech Media</a>, who were one of the first companies who stepped up to back Ghost’s Kickstarter campaign at the partner level. They gave us incredible development rates to build a platform whose size and complexity should have cost many times more.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/gh-pro.jpg" alt="Two Years in: How we Spent The Kickstarter Money, where we are now,  and what’s next for Ghost"></p>

<p>As the vast majority of our Kickstarter reward deliverables comprised of Ghost(Pro) hosting credit - we absolutely had to get this right.</p>

<p>Having an incredible second team building our infrastructure meant that our tiny team of just two full-time developers could devote all of their time to building Ghost itself.</p>

<p>All of this happened in an absolutely break-neck timeframe. From June to September 2013 (4 months), Hannah and a small team of contributors built Ghost 0.3 while aTech built Ghost.org. Then from October to January (4 months), Hannah, Sebastian and a slightly larger group of contributors built Ghost 0.4 while aTech set up 11 servers, 2 switches, and an enormous system to deploy and manage thousands of Ghost(Pro) blogs.</p>

<p>It was a race to get everything up and running as quickly as possible so that we could start generating income to support the long-term future of Ghost with healthy, recurring revenue. As a non-profit organisation, there was no possibility to raise a round of venture capital when the money ran out. </p>

<p><strong>We had a hard deadline with a short runway &amp; just one chance to do it right.</strong></p>

<p>Nothing can prepare you for that sort of pressure. You throw all of your time and energy at an idea which you think will work, and you hope will work, but of course there is no guarantee that it actually <em>will</em> work.</p>

<p><em>Commence: Blood, sweat, tears.</em></p>

<p>We would have hit profitability right on target at 7 months, but we decided to grow the team by 2 more people in the summer - meaning we eventually <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/2014-report/">hit profitability</a> at the 11 month mark in December 2014.</p>

<p>At this milestone, the Kickstarter campaign and everything around it became an official success. We hadn't just built one product and delivered it to our backers, we'd managed to create a sustainable open source business which would keep on going and last for years to come.</p>

<h2 id="wherewearenowandwhatsnextforghost">Where we are now, and what’s next for Ghost</h2>

<p>Two years ago I laid out a plan for what we were going to build that was based on my <a href="http://john.onolan.org/project-ghost/">very first blog post</a> about the idea of Ghost. Now seems like a good time to take stock of how much progress we’ve made towards that initial vision.</p>

<p>Ideas evolve and grow as you work on them, so the longer you spend refining and exploring them - the more they change in shape and scope.</p>

<p>In short, there are some things which were never in the original plan which have turned out to be a dramatic success: Using JavaScript, killer automation for Ghost(Pro), having a free worldwide Content Delivery Network, acquiring Roon.io, incredibly sophisticated built-in SEO, structured data support, dynamic navigation menus and great mobile support.</p>

<p>There are also some things which <strong>were</strong> in the original plan which have turned out to be a dramatic failure. This list is shorter, but far more painful. The long-promised and long-awaited dashboard - and of course: apps for 3rd party integrations. It’s been two years and we’ve failed to deliver - so it’s time to hold ourselves accountable and explain why:</p>

<p>Both apps and the dashboard are massive (extraordinarily large) projects, and we just haven’t had the resources to build them. Our team still comprises of just 3 full time developers, 1 support, 1 ops, and 1 designer running the entire open source project as well as the enormous infrastructure that powers Ghost.org and Ghost(Pro). We bit off a big challenge and we’re chewing like crazy, but these two projects have (so far) proved to be too much for us.</p>

<p>Our biggest failure has been to keep on promising that they’re coming “soon” and not being honest about this. That ends today.</p>

<p>Here’s the skinny on each of them:</p>

<h3 id="apps">Apps</h3>

<p>The scope for apps is BIG and, in short, we’ve been floored with its complexity. When you’re writing code for a single product it’s relatively easy to ship something small and then iterate upon it. But, when you’re writing code to be used by hundreds (or thousands) of 3rd party developers - it comes with a lot of baggage.</p>

<p>Whatever we build is something that people will depend on: we can’t just change whatever we like. This means that we have to spend a very long time considering all the possibilities so that we don’t build the wrong thing and back ourselves into a corner further down the line.</p>

<p>One might argue, however, that it’s better to build something and have it break later - than to build nothing at all.</p>

<p><em>And one would be correct.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/gh-app.jpg" alt="Two Years in: How we Spent The Kickstarter Money, where we are now,  and what’s next for Ghost"></p>

<p>We are going to deliver the first iteration of apps this year. No more waiting around and no more excuses. We're going to start out with a new approach very similar to how <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> built their own <a href="https://github.com/atom/apm">package manager</a>. Initially it will only support free (not paid) themes and apps. After that we'll see where we can take it.</p>

<h3 id="thedashboard">The Dashboard</h3>

<p>This is a difficult conversation to have. When I first came up with the idea for the dashboard it was fresh and exciting. Oh how we frolicked together, flirting with the idea of beautiful stats right in your blog’s admin area. Taking long walks on the beach, imagining all of the possibilities.</p>

<p>But, as time went on, the relationship started to lose its spark. Doing third party analytics integration is a mammoth task with an infinite number of pitfalls and complexities. The best scenario is that you simply have duplicated set of data to what you already have in other places. The worst case scenario is that the whole thing breaks in any number of ways, and it’s of no use at all. It’s an obscenely large amount of work for very little payoff.</p>

<p>The writing has been on the wall for a while now, and I’m afraid it’s not you - dear dashboard - it’s us. We’re breaking up with you.</p>

<p>We are going to do a lot of work on integrated post analytics in future. Allowing you to see who is visiting your blog, what they're reading, for how long, and what they do afterwards are all of massive value and importance. But we're no longer going to pursue the idea of pulling in 3rd party services onto a unified visual dashboard.</p>

<p><a href="https://geckoboard.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/geckoboard.jpg" alt="Two Years in: How we Spent The Kickstarter Money, where we are now,  and what’s next for Ghost" title=""></a></p>

<p>If you still want a dashboard like the the original concept for your blog right now, there is a pretty awesome solution already available: <a href="https://geckoboard.com" target="_blank">Geckoboard</a> have been offering this for years (that's where the original dashboard idea came from!) - and they do an incredible job. We can’t recommend them highly enough.</p>

<p>We’re deeply sorry that we took so long to admit that this concept was out of reach for us. We’ve learned a great deal in the process, and we’re working hard to improve how we communicate planned features in Ghost to make sure this doesn’t happen again.</p>

<h2 id="year3">Year 3</h2>

<p>Today is Ghost’s 2nd birthday, and the start of its 3rd year of life. In the last year alone so many incredible people have started using Ghost for their blogs: <strong>Sky News, Square, NASA, The Bitcoin Foundation, Graze, CodeStarter, Coinbase and Layer</strong> to name just a few.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/gh-now.jpg" alt="Two Years in: How we Spent The Kickstarter Money, where we are now,  and what’s next for Ghost"></p>

<p>If there’s anything that the last 2 years have taught us, it’s that it’s impossible to predict everything that’s going to happen in the next 12 months - so (for a change) I’m not going to try.</p>

<p>But, I will share what our main focuses for this year are. The main areas where we hope to make the most progress:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Ghost JSON API &amp; Apps</li>
<li>Big improvements to our admin UI</li>
<li>A significant upgrade of Ghost(Pro)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to keep track of progress, we have an <a href="http://ideas.ghost.org/">open ideas page</a> where you can submit (and vote on) your ideas for Ghost - as well as a <a href="https://trello.com/b/EceUgtCL/ghost-roadmap">public roadmap</a> showing the exact things we’re working on now and next.</p>

<p>Our biggest challenge, as ever, is doing a very large amount with a very small team. To that end, we always welcome more <a href="https://ghost.org/about/contribute/">contributors</a> to help us build Ghost for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to help, the most amazingly useful thing you can do is to choose to run your blog on <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/">Ghost(Pro)</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Our hosted platform is what funds the entire Ghost Foundation, and the more it succeeds, the more developers we’re able to hire full time to work on Ghost. You can see every single bit of revenue coming in from <strong>Ghost(Pro</strong>) on our <a href="https://ghost.baremetrics.com">public revenue dashboard</a>. This is the biggest contributing factor to how fast we’re able to grow and how much we’re able to accomplish.</p>

                <![CDATA[<img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/editor-upgrade.png" alt="Upgrading The Editor"><p>From the beginning of Ghost’s life, there has always been one very common complaint from users: Why, oh why is there no spell-check?</p>

<p><em>*looks around uncomfortably*</em></p>

<p>We wanted to fix this one sooner, we really did, but the underlying code for our editor was preventing us from being able to do anything about it. Thankfully, we’ve managed to completely overhaul the editor and – while it looks largely the same – under the hood, it’s a whole new beast. </p>

<p><strong>Now</strong>: Your browser’s built-in spell check function works (wohoo!). </p>

<p><strong>Also:</strong> You can do mobile image uploads... and the scrolling doesn’t slow down any more with lots of text... and the scroll-position sync works better... and the cursor doesn’t get lost any more when navigating with keyboard arrows.</p>

<p><em>Phew.</em></p>

<p>Basically it’s the same editor that you’re used to writing with, it just sucks a lot less. Which is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost(Pro</strong>) users already have access to this feature right now, there’s nothing you need to do! Users running Ghost on their own servers can grab this feature by upgrading to <a href="https://ghost.org/download/">Ghost 0.6</a>.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/codeinjec.png" alt="Code Injection"><p>What do you do when you need to inject a small snippet into your Ghost blog, like an analytics tracking code or a simple meta tag?</p>

<p><strong>Before:</strong> you had to laboriously edit your theme files in order to get those common snippets into your blog. Functional, but not very convenient.</p>

<p><strong>Now:</strong> you can use the new code injection feature, which allows you to inject code snippets into the <code>{{ghost_head}}</code> and <code>{{ghost_foot}}</code> helpers of your theme, without ever needing to edit it. It also means you can change themes without losing these snippets!</p>

<p>It’s a small thing, but a very helpful one. We’ve been testing it inside <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/labs/">Ghost Labs</a> for a few months, and now it’s ready for prime-time!</p>

<p>Got ideas for more features that should be in Ghost? Don’t forget to vote on our <a href="http://ideas.ghost.org/">feature wishlist</a>.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Just last week we announced that we’ve made all of our <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/april-2015-update/">revenue figures public</a> in an effort towards more transparency as a business. Today we’re taking another step in that direction by making our Slack team public.</p>

<p>Last year, <a href="http://bit.ly/ghostslack">Slack</a> took the world by storm as it exploded onto the internet with its simple but powerful group messaging application. We’ve been using it internally at the Ghost Foundation since the day of its public launch. But, it hasn’t been accessible to any of the wider Ghost community, who have been largely split between IRC and our forums. </p>

<p>We’re going to try a new approach: Inviting our entire community into Slack and centralising it in one simple place where you know that there will always be someone around to help, chat to, or offer insights. From developer chats and meetings to support request and theme discussion; it’s all going to be under one roof.</p>

<p><a href="https://ghost.org/slack"><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/ghostslack.jpg" alt="Ghost Slack" title=""></a></p>

<h2 id="makingitallwork">Making it all work</h2>

<p>This is a bit of an experiment! A few other open source projects have transitioned to Slack recently and it has worked very well. There are also wider Slack-only communities popping up all the time, like <a href="http://hashtagnomads.com/">#nomads</a>, who have proved that you can made it work with an incredibly large and diverse group of people.</p>

<p>The prospect of opening up our office, <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/distributed-team-tools/">as we consider it</a>, is slightly daunting - but kind of cool.</p>

<p><a href="https://ghost.org/slack/" class="button-save large" style="display:block;">Join The Ghost Slack Team</a></p>

<p>We’d love to chat with you! We hang out in Slack all day every day <strong>(and we're online right now!)</strong>, so <a href="https://ghost.org/slack/">come say hi</a> :)</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>Sometimes little things have a disproportionately large impact. I’m not sure why this seems to surprise me, at this point, but it never fails. Every time one of these rolls around I’m left going <em>“Really? THAT did it?”</em> - weird.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/ghost-onboarding/">last big measured improvement</a> in Ghost’s onboarding process that we talked about was detecting events which improved conversion process the most - and then using targeted emails to drive more people to those “aha” moments. <em>We found one event in particular which improved conversion rate by 1,000%.</em></p>

<p>Today’s change isn’t nearly as dramatic - but it’s also not nearly as complex. While the last test took a good 40-50 hours of design, development and extensive testing. This time we spent 30 minutes on adding one <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to one page, and it gave us 25% bump in how many people try Ghost every day.</p>

<h2 id="thelittlechangethatcould">The Little Change That Could</h2>

<p>Hannah and I sat down a couple of weeks ago to have a look at any quick wins we could make in helping new Ghost users get up to speed faster. We’ve played with various points in the conversion funnel, but on this occasion there was one which was bothering Hannah in particular.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>97% of people who sign up on Ghost.org start a Ghost(Pro) trial, but only 60% of those people are then logging into their blog. This makes no sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agreed with her.</p>

<p>We have a technical issue here which makes things extra complicated. Every Ghost blog on <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/">Ghost(Pro)</a> is an individual install of Ghost. On the plus side, this gives you tons of freedom and control over how your blog runs. On the down side, it makes things a little more complex for the user.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges we have is guiding users through this process without - to be frank - confusing the shit out of them.</p>

<h2 id="theonboardingsteps">The Onboarding Steps</h2>

<p>Here’s how the process looks:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/onboarding2.png" alt="GhostPro Flow diagram"></p>

<ol>
<li>Visit Ghost.org  </li>
<li>Sign up  </li>
<li>Create a blog  </li>
<li>Set up that blog</li>
</ol>

<p>Down to the 3rd screen, the conversion rate is <strong>97%</strong>. Pretty good. However, <strong>only 60%</strong> of people ever made it to the 4th screen. A clear indication of a problem, and one which had been bothering Hannah for a long while.</p>

<p>Now, the “proper” solution to this problem is quite clear: Use Single-Sign-On between Ghost.org and Ghost blogs, so that you can authenticate between the two without the need for these extra screens in the middle. A totally seamless experience. This is the right way to do it. The only problem with that is that it’s a lot of work that needs to happen in Ghost, Ghost.org and Ghost(Pro) to make all the different pieces talk to each other. It's not a small piece of work.</p>

<p>We wanted to do something <em>now</em> to try and improve it, so we decided to do the most obvious thing possible: <strong>Tell people what to do next.</strong></p>

<h2 id="theoldghostpromanager">The Old Ghost(Pro) Manager</h2>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/welcome.png" alt="Old GhostPro blog management screen"></p>

<p>This was the old blog management screen on Ghost.org. Once you understand it, it makes sense: It’s a list of all your blogs, and this is the place where you can setup/shutdown and manage them. But when you’ve just started a new trial and all you see is one little list item… it’s not really clear what this is or what you’re supposed to do with it.</p>

<p>So, in the space of 30 minutes Hannah coded up a re-usable welcome message component for new users, while I designed and marked up the welcome message itself.</p>

<h2 id="thenewghostpromanager">The New Ghost(Pro) Manager</h2>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/welcome.gif" alt="New GhostPro blog management screen"></p>

<p>Now, when you visit the dashboard for the first time, it looks like this. There’s a message telling you what’s going on, the blog is highlighted, and the <strong>next action</strong> we want you to take is literally throbbing in anticipation.</p>

<h2 id="noabtestingjfdi">No A/B Testing - JFDI</h2>

<p>At the beginning of the year I read a post by David Kadavy which systematically destroyed my faith in A/B testing in the space of  about 900 words.</p>

<p><a href="http://kadavy.net/blog/posts/aa-testing/" target="_blank">A/A Testing: How I increased conversions 300% by doing absolutely nothing</a></p>

<p>It’s a great read, and it made me question the statistical significance a lot of the A/B tests we’ve run. As a result, I’ve started thinking differently about how we run our conversion experiments.</p>

<p>In this instance, we had months worth of data showing consistent conversion at a rate of about 60% between starting a trial and setting up a blog. Here’s the week before we tried out the new welcome message, which is consistent with the overall historical rates:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/conv1.png" alt="Conversion rate for week prior to experiment"></p>

<p>There was really no point in running a side-by-side A/B sample. We already had A, so we just went ahead and shipped B to see what would happen.</p>

<p><em>Hypothesis: To establish statistical significance, we would want to see the conversion rate be at least 10% higher than the previous average, consistently (every single day).</em></p>

<p><strong>The week after adding the new welcome message:</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/conv2.png" alt="Conversion rate for week following experiment"></p>

<p>The first week showed 7 consecutive days of improvement at an average of 76%, some <strong>25% higher than the original average</strong>. This streak has continued to 20 days now, and is showing no signs of changing. </p>

<p>If you think 25% doesn’t sound like anything to get excited about, let’s look at how a small change compounds over time with some projected numbers:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/conv2fun.png" alt="The funnel"></p>

<p>This improvement gets us an extra 0.84 customers per day, and  our average <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/">Ghost(Pro)</a> customer Lifetime Value is currently about $200. Basic napkin maths – <code>365 days * ($200 * 0.84)</code> – says that this change will be <strong>worth $61,000 in additional customers each year</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Not bad, for 30 minutes work</em>. </p>

<p>For a non-profit organisation like Ghost, 100% of that extra revenue goes back into the business and makes a massive difference to how much good we’re able to do.</p>

<h2 id="datlowhangingfruit">Dat Low Hanging Fruit</h2>

<p>When people talk about making better software, they often mention <em>“low hanging fruit”</em>. Do the easy things first! They say. Find the small changes which will have the most impact, and save the complicated stuff until later.</p>

<p>The problem with this advice is that it’s really not always obvious <em>what</em> the low hanging fruit is. Much like I mentioned in the <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/ghost-onboarding/">last onboarding post</a>: If you don’t know what the “aha” moments are, you can’t optimise for them.</p>

<p>So the biggest lesson from this post, I think, is simple: When it comes the UX of completing a task; test the most basic thing. Spell out (use your words!) what you want the user to do next. </p>

<p><em>Compounding returns mean that a small change can make a very significant difference over time.</em></p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/ghost-april-update.jpg" alt="Ghost April Update: $411k Annual Revenue, Introducing the Public Revenue Dashboard"><p>In January we <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/2014-report/">announced</a> a big focus on transparency for 2015, and today I’m very pleased to be able to share a big achievement to that effect.</p>

<p><strong>First, here are our numbers after the first 3 months of 2015:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Monthly recurring revenue (MRR</strong>): $34,252 (+17%)</li>
<li><strong>Annual recurring revenue (ARR</strong>): $411,027 (+17%)</li>
<li><strong>Ghost(Pro) subscribers:</strong> 3,764 (+2%)</li>
<li><strong>Average revenue per user:</strong> $9.10 (+15%)</li>
<li><strong>Churn rate:</strong> 7.38% (+52%)</li>
<li><strong>Total downloads:</strong> 560,583 (+11%)</li>
<li><strong>Total users</strong>: 288,485 (+12%)</li>
<li><strong>Team size</strong>: 6 people across 3 continents</li>
</ul>

<p>We had a slow start to the year, with January and February, in particular, being really killer months for our churn rate as people who backed the Kickstarter campaign came to the end of their 12-months coupons - triggering a high level of cancellations. This has started to recover to more normal levels again in March.</p>

<p>It’s nice to see our revenue figures every once in a while when we share an update post like this, but wouldn’t it be cool if you could just see them all the time; with live data showing all our transactions, as they happen?</p>

<h2 id="introducingthepublicrevenuedashboard">Introducing the Public Revenue Dashboard</h2>

<p>As our friends at Buffer <a href="https://open.bufferapp.com/buffer-public-revenue-dashboard/">did</a> just under a year ago, today we’re opening up our real-time, streaming Baremetrics dashboard.</p>

<p><strong>Transparency and integrity are the two most important values to us both in software and in business - as they are in journalism itself</strong>. It’s a very natural thing for us to want to share this data as openly and objectively as possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://ghost.baremetrics.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/baremetrics1.png" alt="Ghost April Update: $411k Annual Revenue, Introducing the Public Revenue Dashboard" title=""></a></p>

<p>As of today you — and everyone else — have access to a live-stream of our transactions <em>as and when</em> they take place on Ghost.org as well as a big list of all our most important key metrics, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)</li>
<li>Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)</li>
<li>Net revenue</li>
<li>Fees</li>
<li>Average revenue per user</li>
<li>Lifetime value</li>
<li>User churn</li>
<li>Revenue churn</li>
<li>Number of customers</li>
<li>Upgrades</li>
<li>Downgrades</li>
<li>Cancellations</li>
<li>Failed charges</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://ghost.baremetrics.com" class="button-save large" style="display:block;" target="_blank">Open the Public Revenue Dashboard</a></p>

<p>In truth, we wanted to do this much sooner but we weren’t able to because of how we’d implemented our billing. Previously: We used Stripe to handle payments, but all recurring-billing and management was done within our own systems. Now: We use the full Stripe Plans API - which is what Baremetrics hooks into.</p>

<p><strong>Important note:</strong> In January we transferred all customers over from the old billing system to the new one when their subscription renewed. This means Baremetrics only has accurate metrics from February onwards. The historical comparison charts (Particularly Churn and LTV) are currently inaccurate as they reflect skewed data from the switch-over. This will normalise over time.</p>

<p><a href="https://ghost.baremetrics.com/stats/net_revenue?start_date=2013-12-01&amp;end_date=2015-04-01" targe="_blank"><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/04/baremetrics2.png" alt="Ghost April Update: $411k Annual Revenue, Introducing the Public Revenue Dashboard" title=""></a></p>

<p>Using the <em>Net Revenue</em> detail view it is possible to scroll through our transaction history all the way back to the launch of <strong>Ghost(Pro</strong>) in January 2014, as this view includes all Stripe charges (even ones outside of the Plans API).</p>

<p>A big thank you to <strong>Josh Pigford</strong> and the team at <a href="https://baremetrics.com/">Baremetrics</a> for making this possible - as well as <strong>Joel Gascoigne</strong> of <a href="https://buffer.com">Buffer</a> for his tireless advice and insights.</p>

<h2 id="moreontheway">More on the way</h2>

<p>As a non-profit foundation building open source tools for journalism, doing things like this is central to everything we care deeply about.</p>

<p>Opening up our revenue publicly is just the beginning. In the coming months we're going to continue to release valuable data about Ghost as an organisation (as well as a product) to everyone who is interested in hearing about it.</p>

<p>We hope that those of you interested can learn from our successes and failures. More importantly, we hope that this type of post gives you a clear view of Ghost as an organisation and the things we believe in.</p>

<h2 id="asmallfavour">A small favour</h2>

<p>We’d love your help to share the news of our new progress and our new public dashboard. Getting Ghost in front of more people makes more of a difference than pretty much anything else!</p>

<p>Here’s a pre-written status, to make it extra simple:</p>

                <![CDATA[<img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/03/markdown-guide-1.jpg" alt="How to Write Faster, Better & Longer: The Ultimate Guide to Markdown"><p>It’s no secret that we’re big fans of <strong>Markdown</strong> at <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a>. We pretty much built our entire editor around it!</p>

<p>Once you get the hang of Markdown, it’s an incredibly powerful writing tool which will allow you to write rich content for the web far faster than almost any other method. To get to that point, however, there’s a little bit of a learning curve. We thought we’d put together an all inclusive guide to make that curve a little bit shorter, and potentially teach you a few super-user tricks to Markdown that you might not have known.</p>

<h2 id="whatismarkdown">What is Markdown</h2>

<p><strong>Markdown</strong> is a plain text formatting syntax for writers. It allows you to quickly write structured content for the web, and have it seamlessly converted to clean, structured HTML.</p>

<p>Back in 2004, Apple pundit John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">came up with the idea</a> after becoming frustrated by writing long, laborious HTML tags to properly format his content. He devised a simple writing system which would make web based documents both easier to write, and easier to read in their raw state.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick example of Markdown in action:</p>

<pre><code>The *quick* brown fox, jumped **over** the lazy [dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog).  
</code></pre>

<p>becomes</p>

<p>The <em>quick</em> brown fox, jumped <strong>over</strong> the lazy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog">dog</a>.</p>

<p>With just a couple of extra characters, Markdown makes rich document formatting quick and beautiful. </p>

<h2 id="whydowriterslovemarkdownsomuch">Why do Writers Love Markdown so Much?</h2>

<p>“Is that it?” - I hear you ask - “I could just click on a few formatting buttons in most editors and achieve the same thing!”</p>

<p>Very true! But we’re only just getting started. The range of formatting tools has come a very long way since Markdown’s inception in 2004, so you’d be forgiven for wondering what advantages it holds over, say, the “Bold” button in Microsoft Word.</p>

<p>While most novice users do indeed find buttons a bit easier to use, advanced writers often swear by Markdown and nothing else. Why? The biggest reason is <em>writing flow</em>.</p>

<p>Using a traditional writing user interface you have to pause your writing every few minutes (or sometimes seconds) and reach for the mouse in order to click, highlight, click a formatting button, and then click back to where you left off in order to continue. This process creates a tiresome, disjointed experience when all you want to do is get the words out of your head and onto the screen.</p>

<p>Markdown allows you to keep your fingers firmly planted on the keyboard as you apply formatting on the fly. In short: You never have to stop typing or think about anything else in order to apply your styles.</p>

<p>It might seem like a small detail, but it can have a really big effect. Once you start writing in Markdown, it’s really hard to back to the click-fest of the past.</p>

<h2 id="basicmarkdownformatting">Basic Markdown Formatting</h2>

<p>Ok! You’re sold. So how does this work? Let’s dive in:</p>

<p>Markdown was designed with the explicit intention to be easily readable by humans. You should find that most of the syntax is pretty simple and intuitive. </p>

<p>Here are the elements you’ll use most often:</p>

<h3 id="headings">Headings</h3>

<pre><code># Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
</code></pre>

<p>Headings in Markdown are any line which is prefixed with a <code>#</code> symbol. The number of hashes indicates the level of the heading. One hash is converted to an <strong>h1</strong>, two hashes to an <strong>h2</strong> and so on. There are a total of <strong>6</strong> levels which you can make use of - but for most writing, you’ll rarely ever need more than 3.</p>

<h3 id="text">Text</h3>

<pre><code>*italic*
**bold**
***bold-italic***
[link](http://example.com)
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to emphasise a word a <em>little</em> bit, wrap it in asterisks. For something that needs <strong>more</strong> emphasis: double asterisks. If you really want to <strong><em>drive</em></strong> the point home, use triple asterisks. If you prefer, you can also use underscores - they’re completely interchangeable. </p>

<p>To add a link: wrap the text which you want to be linked in square brackets, followed by the URL to be linked to in parenthesis. An easy way to remember this one is to think of it like turning a word into a button. <code>[button]</code> and <code>(place to go when the button is clicked)</code> combine to form a <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/markdown/#">link</a>.</p>

<h3 id="images">Images</h3>

<pre><code>![m'lady](http://i.imgur.com/v8IVDka.jpg)
</code></pre>

<p>Markdown images have exactly the same formatting as a link, except they’re prefixed with a <code>!</code>. This time, the text in brackets is the <code>alt text</code> - or the descriptive text for the image.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/v8IVDka.jpg" alt="How to Write Faster, Better & Longer: The Ultimate Guide to Markdown"></p>

<p>In most Markdown editors, you don’t have to write this code out. They will provide a tool to allow you to upload an image and insert this code automatically. After that, it will appear in your document.</p>

<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>

<pre><code>* Milk
* Bread
    * Wholegrain
* Butter
</code></pre>

<pre><code>1. Tidy the kitchen  
2. Prepare ingredients  
3. Cook delicious things  
</code></pre>

<p>Lists are a formatting nightmare in HTML, but Markdown lists are incredibly easy to manage. For a bullet list, just prefix each like with a <code>*</code> - or <code>-</code> or <code>+</code> and they will be converted to dots. You can also create nested lists; just indent a line with <em>4 spaces</em> and it will be nested under the line above.</p>

<ul>
<li>Milk</li>
<li>Bread
<ul><li>Wholegrain</li></ul></li>
<li>Butter</li>
</ul>

<p>For numbered lists, do exactly the same thing - but use numbers!</p>

<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>

<pre><code>&gt; To be or not to be, that is the question.
</code></pre>

<p>When you want to add a quote in Markdown, it’s exactly the same as the formatting which you may already be familiar with from your email app of choice when you reply to someone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be or not to be, that is the question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prefixing the line with a <code>&gt;</code> converts it into a block-quote.</p>

<h3 id="howcanirememberallthemarkdownsyntax">How can I remember all the Markdown syntax?!</h3>

<p>It seems a little daunting at first, but you might be surprised how naturally it comes to you after a couple of posts written in Markdown. Most good Markdown editors come with a built-in cheat sheet to make it a little easier to learn.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/03/ghost-markdown-help.jpg" alt="How to Write Faster, Better & Longer: The Ultimate Guide to Markdown"></p>

<p>Here’s the one you can pull up from the <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> editor at any time if you get stuck.</p>

<h2 id="intermediatemarkdownformatting">Intermediate Markdown Formatting</h2>

<p>So you’ve got the Markdown basics nailed and you want to move on to bigger and better things? Excellent. There’s much more we can do. </p>

<h3 id="horizontalrules">Horizontal Rules</h3>

<pre><code>---
</code></pre>

<p>Want to throw-down a quick divider in your article to denote a visual separation between different sections of text? No problem. 3 dashes produce:</p>

<hr>

<p>A sleek <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> element.</p>

<h3 id="codesnippets">Code Snippets</h3>

<pre><code>Some text with an inline `code` snippet  
</code></pre>

<pre><code>    .my-link {
        text-decoration: underline;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>If you’re a technical writer, you may want to use example snippets of code to teach your readers a particular syntax (like I’m doing, with this very blog post). Using a single back-tick around a word in a sentence, you can show a quick <code>code</code> snippet. </p>

<p>Indenting by <strong>4 spaces</strong> will turn an entire paragraph into a code-block.</p>

<h3 id="referenceliststitles">Reference Lists &amp; Titles</h3>

<pre><code>**The quick brown [fox][1], jumped over the lazy [dog][2].**

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox "Wikipedia: Fox"
[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog "Wikipedia: Dog"
</code></pre>

<p>If you prefer to use reference lists for your attribution, Markdown can handle this, too. In the above example, all of the links are kept separate in Markdown (so it's easy to read even in its raw format), and then inserted directly as normal links when converted to HTML.</p>

<p><strong>The quick brown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox" title="Wikipedia: Fox">fox</a>, jumped over the lazy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" title="Wikipedia: Dog">dog</a>.</strong></p>

<p>You'll also notice that we've added a title attribute to the links by adding a <code>"word"</code> in quote marks just after the URL. Anywhere you use a URL, you can follow it with a <code>"title in quotation marks"</code> to generate a title attribute.</p>

<pre><code>[Dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog "Wikipedia: Dog")
</code></pre>

<h3 id="escaping">Escaping</h3>

<pre><code>\*literally\*
</code></pre>

<p>What if you <em>literally</em> want to type *literally* - without it appearing in italics? Escaping Markdown characters with a back-slash <code>\</code> allows you to use any characters which might be getting accidentally converted into HTML.</p>

<h3 id="embeddinghtml">Embedding HTML</h3>

<pre><code>&lt;button class="button-save large"&gt;Big Fat Button&lt;/button&gt;  
</code></pre>

<p>Possibly the coolest feature of Markdown is that it also just supports plain old HTML. If you find yourself stuck and unable to do what you want in Markdown - you can simply write in regular HTML and it will work just fine.</p>

<p><button href="http://blog.ghost.org/markdown/#" class="button-save large">Big Fat Button</button></p>

<p>In the above example, I know that within this blog's stylesheet is the CSS to style a nice button that with a <code>class</code> attribute.</p>

<p>So you can drop in any HTML, sharing button, JavaScript snippet or iFrame you like and it will work on the page just as normal.</p>

<h2 id="advancedmarkdown">Advanced Markdown</h2>

<p>Ok, you want the big guns. Every example so far has been vanilla, normal Markdown. Those code snippets will work absolutely anywhere which supports Markdown syntax.</p>

<p>Now we're going to look at some syntax which is <strong>not standard</strong> to native Markdown. They're extensions of the language. All of these things work in <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a>, but they may not work in other editors.</p>

<p>Here are some nice advanced things you can do with Markdown in Ghost:</p>

<h3 id="strikethroughs">Strike-throughs</h3>

<pre><code>~~deleted words~~
</code></pre>

<p><del>deleted words</del></p>

<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>

<pre><code>==oooh fancy==
</code></pre>

<p><mark>oooh fancy</mark></p>

<h3 id="automaticlinks">Automatic Links</h3>

<pre><code>https://ghost.org  
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://ghost.org">https://ghost.org</a></p>

<h3 id="markdownfootnotes">Markdown Footnotes</h3>

<pre><code>The quick brown fox[^1] jumped over the lazy dog[^2].

[^1]: Foxes are red
[^2]: Dogs are usually not red
</code></pre>

<p>The quick brown fox<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://blog.ghost.org/markdown/#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> jumped over the lazy dog<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="http://blog.ghost.org/markdown/#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="syntaxhighlighting">Syntax Highlighting</h3>

<pre><code>```language-javascript
   [...]
```
</code></pre>

<p>Combined with <a href="http://prismjs.com/">Prism.js</a> in the Ghost theme:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// # Notifications API
// RESTful API for creating notifications
var Promise            = require('bluebird'),  
    _                  = require('lodash'),
    canThis            = require('../permissions').canThis,
    errors             = require('../errors'),
    utils              = require('./utils'),

    // Holds the persistent notifications
    notificationsStore = [],
    // Holds the last used id
    notificationCounter = 0,
    notifications;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="speedupyourworkflowwithmarkdownkeyboardshortcuts">Speed up Your Workflow with Markdown Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>

<p>Writing Markdown is pretty quick right out of the box, but you can speed it up even further by getting to know the keyboard shortcuts in your editor of choice. These all tend to be a little different, but in Ghost you can access some on-the-fly formatting very easily:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ctrl + B for <strong>Bold</strong></li>
<li>Ctrl + I for <em>Italic</em></li>
<li>Ctrl + K for a <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/markdown/">link</a></li>
<li>Tap Ctrl + H multiple times for the most common <strong>H2</strong> and <strong>H3</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There are lots more included in the <em>Markdown Help</em> overlay in the editor. Regardless of which app you use to write, it's work figuring out the Markdown keyboard shortcuts available to speed up your workflow.</p>

<h2 id="convertinghtmltomarkdown">Converting HTML to Markdown</h2>

<p>If you're just getting into Markdown and you've found yourself with a massive back-log of old files which are written in HTML, you might want to convert them to Markdown to make them easier to work with in future.</p>

<p><a href="http://domchristie.github.io/to-markdown/">Here's a handy tool</a> by Dom Christie which lets you do exactly that.</p>

<p>Creating the world's greatest <em>(and most modest, obviously)</em> publishing platform is no small task. We have more plans for Ghost than a hipster at a typewriter convention. But sometimes we wonder: <em>What's the most important thing that we should be working on next?</em></p>

<p>For the last few months, we've published a <a href="https://trello.com/b/EceUgtCL/ghost-roadmap">public roadmap</a> of the things we're working on, and allowed people to vote for the things they care about the most. There have been two shortcomings though: </p>

<ol>
<li>Most people don't know that it exists  </li>
<li>You can only vote on the features which are already there. If you have a request that's not on the list already... well... you're stuck.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/03/ghideas.png" alt="Send us Your Requests"></p>

<p>The <a href="http://ideas.ghost.org">wishlist</a> menu item now will take you over to our new Uservoice feedback forum where you can <strong>submit as well as vote on the features and ideas which you would like to see in Ghost</strong>. Much simpler.</p>

Additionally you can personalise your tag archives by adding cover images and meta data to your tags.</p>

<p>For anyone who is using the default theme, your tag archives will use the new data right away. If you're using a custom theme, you can output tag cover images inside <code>tag.hbs</code> using the <code>{{image}}</code> helper. Simple :)</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/01/tag-management.gif" alt="Tag Management"></p>

<p>Developers can find out about the updates made to theme helpers in the <a href="http://themes.ghost.org/docs/changelog">Theme API Changelog</a>.</p>

<p><em>We're looking forward to seeing even more beautiful tag archives!</em></p>

<p><strong>Ghost(Pro)</strong> users can start using this feature immediately. Users running Ghost on their own servers can grab this feature by upgrading to <a href="https://ghost.org/download/">Ghost 0.5.8</a>.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/01/2014progress.jpg" alt="Lessons Learned Building an Open Source Product from $0 to $350,000/year in 12 months"><p>Just a year ago we launched our <strong>Ghost(Pro)</strong> hosted platform to allow people to easily deploy and run Ghost blogs. </p>

<p>We’ve come a long way.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, during the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform">Kickstarter Campaign</a>, we put forward the idea of a hosted platform for an Open Source project as a means to make it both sustainable and profitable.</p>

<p>At that point it was really just a theory and a dream. No Open Source project had ever done anything quite like it before.</p>

<p><strong>Today, the Ghost Foundation turns over $350,000 and, even more significantly: is profitable.</strong></p>

<p>2014 was a pretty incredible year. It’s surreal to look back at just how far we’ve come. 2015 is set to be even bigger.</p>

<h2 id="abiggerfocusontransparency">A Bigger Focus on Transparency</h2>

<p>For the last year we’ve realised that a lot of things we’re passionate about are symptoms of something larger. Ghost is Open Source because we believe in free and open software which is available to everyone to use, hack and redistribute as they see fit. Ghost is not-for-profit because we believe in building an incredible company which is dedicated to its users, rather than creating wealth for its founders.</p>

<p>We’ve realised the larger umbrella that embodies all of these elements that ties them all together is quite simple: Transparency.</p>

<p>What we’re really excited about is building a company with integrity that’s completely open about what it does and why.</p>

<p>This year we’re going to place a much bigger focus on being even more aggressive about the number of things which we open up to the public. We’ve learned a lot from our friends over at <a href="http://bufferapp.com">Buffer</a> and we’re going to be taking a leaf out of their book in several ways.</p>

<p>We’ve got tons of exciting things planned around this, and we’re starting out with a very simple one: Revenue reports.</p>

<h2 id="ghost2014revenuereport">Ghost 2014 Revenue Report</h2>

<p>We’re going to try and do these every month from now on, but to start with here’s a roundup of how we did last year:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/01/mrrgraph.png" alt="Lessons Learned Building an Open Source Product from $0 to $350,000/year in 12 months"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Unique visitors:</strong> 3,284,749</li>
<li><strong>Total downloads:</strong> 504,949</li>
<li><strong>Total users</strong>: 257,307</li>
<li><strong>Ghost(Pro) subscribers:</strong> 3,675</li>
<li><strong>Monthly recurring revenue (MRR</strong>): $29,177</li>
<li><strong>Annual recurring revenue (ARR</strong>): $350,124</li>
<li><strong>Average revenue per user:</strong> $7.94</li>
<li><strong>Churn rate:</strong> 4.87%</li>
<li><strong>Team size</strong>: 6 people across 3 continents</li>
</ul>

<p>The overwhelming majority of our internal focus last year was on getting MRR up to make us profitable. Ghost Foundation being profitable makes it a sustainable business that can keep on going without outside investment. We prioritised high-traction features and did a lot of work on our pricing to reach this point.</p>

<p>We could have hit profitability in June, had we kept the team smaller - but we expanded to 6 full time people in order to be able to keep shipping new features in line with demand, so we eventually hit this milestone in December.</p>

<p>MRR is currently growing at around 8% month on month, which is definitely something we’d like to improve - but the pressure in 2015 is much lower than it was last year. Which is great!</p>

<h2 id="lesson1gettingpricingrightiscritical">Lesson 1: Getting Pricing Right is Critical</h2>

<p>Launching one of the world’s first consumer Node.js apps was like diving into a black-hole when it came to setting up a hosted infrastructure. We had almost no idea how much it was going to cost, what the margins would be like, or where we should even begin with charging.</p>

<p>We started out with a base $5/month plan with a few higher options, all the way up to $80/month for the highest plan.</p>

<p>After spending a lot of time doing customer development, researching and talking with the fantastic team at <a href="http://www.priceintelligently.com/">Price Intelligently</a> - we worked on a new plan structure with new pricing. The base plan would now be $10/month and range all the way up to $250/month for business users.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/01/pricingabtest.png" alt="Lessons Learned Building an Open Source Product from $0 to $350,000/year in 12 months"></p>

<p>Having run a 33 day A/B test on the new pricing prior to changing it, we found that the price change actually lead to an <em>increase</em> in conversion rate. So, 2x the revenue and more customers than before. Despite a little negative feedback when we <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/new-ghostpro-plans/">announced it</a> at the end of September, the data told us that the new pricing was clearly the right way to go.</p>

<p>Pricing is something that’s never “finished” - and we’re planning to do more experiments in 2015 to optimise this further. The goal is always to give as much value to customers as we can, while creating a healthy business.</p>

<p>The most important lesson we learned here was that <strong>it’s really, really hard to build a viable business with $5/month plans</strong>. We’ve seen several other “Ghost hosting” companies enter and subsequently exit the market with price ranges from $2.99 to $5.99 - which isn’t a big surprise. Increasing our average revenue per user has been an enormous weight off our shoulders, and given us a lot more room to work with.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in anything to do with product pricing: I can’t recommend the <a href="http://www.priceintelligently.com/blog/all">Price Intelligently blog</a> highly enough. I’ve spent hours reading and re-reading their posts.</p>

<h2 id="lesson2asmallchangeatthestartofthefunnelhasamassiveimpactattheend">Lesson 2: A Small Change at The Start of The Funnel Has a Massive Impact at The End</h2>

<p>We refer to the “funnel” as the process of moving a customer through the various stages of the onboarding process. Usually it looks something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>User signs up [10,000 people]</li>
<li>User starts trial [4,000 people]</li>
<li>User sets up product for first time [2,000 people]</li>
<li>User becomes a subscriber [400 people]</li>
</ul>

<p>At each stage of the funnel there’s a conversion rate which can be worked on as you try to nudge users toward completing your desired goal: eg. becoming a subscriber. </p>

<p>The interesting thing is that each step of the funnel impacts every step of the funnel below it (but not above). So, while it can be tempting to just work on the conversion rate of your end-of-trial page at the very end… it can actually have a far larger impact to just get a 1% increase in the number of people who are starting trials right at the start of the funnel.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2014/10/Slice-3.png" alt="Lessons Learned Building an Open Source Product from $0 to $350,000/year in 12 months"></p>

<p>We <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/ghost-onboarding/">figured out what caused</a> users to be 1,000% more likely to convert to paying customers. When we applied this learning, we were immediately able to see a 370% conversion rate increase further down the funnel. There was no way we could have gotten a 370% increase in conversions just by working on A/B testing to improve that one particular page. To improve one action, we had to look upstream first.</p>

<p>This was a super interesting lesson.</p>

<p><strong>A tangential lesson here, too:</strong> Make sure your analytics actually work correctly. There’s nothing worse than finding out you implemented a piece of tracking very slightly wrong, and now your last 6 months of data is totally meaningless and can’t be used for any kind of segmentation or analysis. Sounds obvious - but we’ve found flaws in our tracking implementations over and over and over again. It’s way easier to screw up than you might imagine.</p>

<h2 id="lesson3ifsomethingfeelsweirdandbrokenitprobablyis">Lesson 3: If Something Feels Weird and Broken, it Probably is</h2>

<p>For the first half of the year or so, we did a big-bang release of Ghost every few months. We named each version and made a big fuss about what version number it was. We included details of all the things that had been worked on since the last release, and provided instructions on how to update.</p>

<p>This is how almost every single Open Source project in the world works, but after a while, it started to feel pretty weird and broken.</p>

<p>Why, in 2014, would you only release software a few times a year? Why do people constantly have to update? How can developers ever learn from user behaviour or improve on their work, when there’s a 6 month gap between usage and iteration?</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2014/Aug/05-team.jpg" alt="Lessons Learned Building an Open Source Product from $0 to $350,000/year in 12 months"></p>

<p><em>In August <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/ghost-0-5/">we announced</a> Ghost 0.5, and noted that it would be the last release in this format</em>.</p>

<p>Since then, we’ve moved to an agile release process - shipping new things every 2-4 weeks. In the last 4 months of 2014 <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/releases">we released</a> 7 different versions of Ghost. In 2015 that number is only going to increase as we automate more of the process.</p>

<p>Best of all - we automatically push these updates out to all <strong>Ghost(Pro)</strong> customers in the background. This isn’t just a better experience all round for everyone, but it also added a significant extra feature/benefit to using our hosted platform which would drive more people to using it.</p>

<p>Looking back, it seems insane that we ever did releases any other way. If you’re doing something because “that’s the way it’s always been done” - it might be time to try something new.</p>

<h2 id="sowhatscomingin2015">So What’s Coming in 2015?</h2>

<p><em>Lots.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2015/01/roadmap.png" alt="Lessons Learned Building an Open Source Product from $0 to $350,000/year in 12 months"></p>

<p>The <a href="https://trello.com/b/EceUgtCL/ghost-roadmap">Ghost Roadmap</a> is pretty full right now, and we’re incredibly motivated to ship the things which are in high demand, especially:</p>

<ul>
<li>Editor improvements (Spellcheck!)</li>
<li>Tag management</li>
<li>Navigation menus</li>
<li>Code injection</li>
<li>Post scheduling</li>
</ul>

<p><em>A major focus for the rest of the year is going to be around Apps and the <a href="http://marketplace.ghost.org/">Ghost Marketplace</a>.</em></p>

<p>We’ve been talking about this for a long time, and haven’t made much progress because it’s such a major project. This year we’re hoping to finally make some serious progress on allowing other apps and services to integrate with Ghost, and vice versa.</p>

<p>We know there are multiple issues with the current marketplace (which is really just a placeholder showcase gallery), and that’s something we’re going to be looking to completely overhaul in 2015. The long term plan is to have it look and feel a lot more like an Apple App Store or Google Play Store type experience. Shopify have done a pretty great job with <a href="https://themes.shopify.com/">their marketplace</a>, which should give some indication of things we’d like to do.</p>

<p>There’s also going to be an increased focus on content for this blog (we’re going to share lots more), as well as work towards making Ghost and Ghost.org much more friendly for translation into other languages.</p>

<p>If there’s anything you’d like to see us writing about, sharing, or doing - or if you have any questions about what else we did in 2014: Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for being a part of this journey and making it all possible. Without you, we’d be absolutely nowhere.</em></p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<img src="http://blog.ghost.org/content/images/2014/12/sitemaps-1.png" alt="XML Sitemaps"><p><em>One of the most important aspects of any blog is its discoverability.</em> When you write a post, it's usually because you want someone to read it! For this reason, making your content search engine and social network friendly is extremely important.</p>

<p>Two months ago we added <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/post-meta/">custom post meta</a> to Ghost by default so that you can customise the data which you send to these places. A month ago, we added <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/structured-data/">structured data</a> support, so that social networks and search engines are able to read your custom post meta more easily.</p>

<p><strong>Today, we're introducing automatic XML sitemaps as core functionality within Ghost to take this another step further.</strong></p>

<p>An <a href="http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo/search-engine-tools-and-services">XML sitemap</a> is a complete list of all the pages on your site, in a format which can be easily consumed by search engines. In short, it's a page which tells Google where all your content lives that it should crawl and place in its search results.</p>

<p>You can see an example of the sitemap for our own blog right here: <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/sitemap.xml" target="_blank">http://blog.ghost.org/sitemap.xml</a></p>

<p>We've also updated Ghost's <code>robots.txt</code> with a link to your sitemap, so that search engines are able to discover it automatically even if you don't go through a manual submission process via something like <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools">Google WebMaster Tools</a>.</p>

<p><em>This feature is a major step forward in Ghost's native SEO support. Enjoy your new and improved rankings!</em></p>

<p><strong>Ghost(Pro)</strong> users already have sitemaps running right now, there's nothing you need to do! Users running Ghost on their own servers can grab this feature by upgrading to <a href="https://ghost.org/download/">Ghost 0.5.7</a>.</p>]]>
