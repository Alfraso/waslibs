For all their tireless activity as a live group (in which Hayward is joined by his fellow longtime members John Lodge and Graeme Edge) and several reissue packages via USM and elsewhere, the Moody Blues have not released any new material for more than 20 years. Their last album of new songs was the Christmas-themed ‘December’ album towards the end of 1993, but their joint frontman has revealed to Prog magazine that there has been a recent development. “There is now a plan for us to do something audiovisual in the near future, and this would include one or two new songs,” he says. “But I really can&#8217;t say anything further at the moment. I&#8217;m not trying to be mysterious. It&#8217;s just that we haven&#8217;t yet worked out what we&#8217;ll do. So, you now know as much about this project as I do.” Hayward released a solo album, ‘Spirits Of The Western Sky,’ in 2013, and Lodge’s new solo set ’10,000 Light Years Ago,’ came out last month. The group’s UK tour continues tomorrow night (Tuesday 16) in Manchester and ends on June 22 in Newcastle. They have also announced details of their third Moody Blues cruise, titled ‘Lovely To See You,’ to take place between February 26 and March 1 next year. The NCL Pearl will sail from Florida to the Bahamas, with live music by the Moodies and guests including Christopher Cross, Renaissance, the Zombies, Ambrosia, Randy Hansen, the Orchestra, the Ides of March, Rare Earth and Mellow Yellow. There will also be a tribute set by Matthew and Gunnar Nelson to their late father and longtime American pop-rock hero, the ‘Ricky Nelson Remembered’ show.

Album releases came thick and fast in those days. The Michigan rock trio had only released their sophomore set, ‘Grand Funk,’ on New Year’s Day, and it had reached its No. 11 peak only in March. That in itself was a substantial improvement on the No. 27 peak of their 1969 debut set ‘On Time.’ But now it was time to take things up another notch, both in record sales and in the way the band were marketed. As ‘Closer To Home’ was released, GFR spent $100,000, a huge figure for the times, on the billboard seen here, which ran along a whole block of Times Square in New York. No one in the Big Apple, at least, was going to be unaware that they had a new album out. Jonathan Eisen, writing in Circus magazine at the time, took a humorous approach. “I went downtown to take a look at the billboard they had erected for themselves on Times Square,” he told his readers. “First of all it was bigger by far than the one John and Yoko rented this winter and it didn&#8217;t say all that much about peace either, which was ok, since why confuse commercialism with peace anyway?”. In July, Grand Funk played songs from the new release at the New York Pop festival event at Downing Stadium, Randall’s Island in New York, sharing the bill with Jimi Hendrix, Jethro Tull, John Sebastian and Steppenwolf. By August, the album was peaking on the US chart at No. 6, despite the band’s now-traditional poor reviews from a sniffy media, and by late October its near-title track ‘(I’m Your Captain) Closer To Home’ was given GFR their first top 40 hit single, peaking at No. 22. One of the exceptions in terms of favourable press came in Billboard, who wrote in their review of the album: “The ‘together’ group again proves highly innovative within contemporary rock boundaries. In driving, pulsing songs such as ‘Sin&#8217;s A Good Man&#8217;s Brother’ or ‘Get It Together’ and ‘I Don&#8217;t Have to Sing the Blues,’ the group has few peers. The music is expressive, exciting, often funky, always good. A bow to producer Terry Knight.” Listen to ‘Closer To Home’ on Spotify Explore our dedicated Grand Funk Railroad Artist Page]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<div><img width="150" height="150" src="http://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rory-Gallagher-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Rory Gallagher" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" /></div>Can it really be 20 years already since we lost Rory Gallagher? The blues-rock guitar virtuoso was a cruelly young 47 when he died after complications from a liver transplant on June 14, 1995. William Rory Gallagher was born in Ballyshannon in County Donegal and raised in Cork. He began to whip up a storm with his guitar sorcery when he co-founded the trio Taste in 1966, when he was a mere 18. When they started to go international, a couple of years later, they won admiring glances from fans of Cream (for whose famed farewell Royal Albert Hall concert they opened) and Blind Faith, the short-lived supergroup on whose North American dates they also guested). Taste only lasted until 1970 themselves, but by then they had played at that year’s Isle of Wight Festival and made two studio albums. The second, ‘On The Boards,’ was a top 20 success in the UK, and when Gallagher swiftly started recording in his own name under a new solo deal with Atlantic, he made the top 40 with his self-titled debut and a swift follow-up, ‘Deuce,’ both in 1971. They were the first in a long line of releases to win either silver or gold certification, and it’s appropriate that the sole Gallagher album to make the UK top ten was one on which his celebrated, blistering style as a live performer was commemorated, on 1972’s ‘Live In Europe.’ That also enjoyed by far his longest chart run, at 15 weeks. The next year, ‘Blueprint’ gave Rory his initial US album chart appearance. Never one to court fame for its own sake, Gallagher continued to enhance his awesome reputation with his prolific recording and touring for the rest of his life.

                <![CDATA[<div><img width="150" height="150" src="http://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rory-Gallagher-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Rory Gallagher" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" /></div><p>Can it really be 20 years already since we lost Rory Gallagher? The blues-rock guitar virtuoso was a cruelly young 47 when he died after complications from a liver transplant on June 14, 1995. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-22578 size-full" src="http://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Taste.jpg" alt="Taste" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>William Rory Gallagher was born in Ballyshannon in County Donegal and raised in Cork. He began to whip up a storm with his guitar sorcery when he co-founded the trio Taste in 1966, when he was a mere 18. When they started to go international, a couple of years later, they won admiring glances from fans of <a title="Cream" href="http://www.udiscovermusic.com/artists/cream"><strong>Cream</strong></a> (for whose famed farewell Royal Albert Hall concert they opened) and Blind Faith, the short-lived supergroup on whose North American dates they also guested).</p>
<p>Taste only lasted until 1970 themselves, but by then they had played at that year’s Isle of Wight Festival and made two studio albums. The second, ‘On The Boards,’ was a top 20 success in the UK, and when Gallagher swiftly started recording in his own name under a new solo deal with Atlantic, he made the top 40 with his self-titled debut and a swift follow-up, ‘Deuce,’ both in 1971.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22579 size-full" src="http://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Live-In-Europe.jpg" alt="Live In Europe" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>They were the first in a long line of releases to win either silver or gold certification, and it’s appropriate that the sole Gallagher album to make the UK top ten was one on which his celebrated, blistering style as a live performer was commemorated, on 1972’s ‘Live In Europe.’ That also enjoyed by far his longest chart run, at 15 weeks. The next year, ‘Blueprint’ gave Rory his initial US album chart appearance. <img class="alignright wp-image-22580 size-full" src="http://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Fresh-Evidence.jpg" alt="Fresh Evidence" width="300" height="296" /></p>
<p>Never one to court fame for its own sake, Gallagher continued to enhance his awesome reputation with his prolific recording and touring for the rest of his life. His last studio album, his 11th, was 1990’s ‘Fresh Evidence.’ He had plans to tour the record, release an EP and more besides, at the time of his death.</p>
<p>But it was always all about the music for Rory Gallagher. &#8220;Regardless of fashions there are still blues and rockabilly fans,” he told Chris Welch in Metal Hammer in one of his last interviews. “Certainly for a while, the press overlooked rootsy music [which] they thought was old fashioned and irrelevant.</p>

The two shows were for Dr. Spock’s Civil Liberties Legal Defence Fund (USA) and were top take place on Sunday 14 June. The other three members of the band, according to the Melody Maker would be, “organist, Bobby Whitlock drummer, Jim Keltner and bassist, Carl Radle”. Between the announcement of the gig and the actual gig Keltner, who was busy working with jazz guitarist Gabor Szabo on an album had been replaced by Jim Gordon. Bobby Whitlock, Jim Gordon and Carl Raddle had all toured Europe with Delaney and Bonnie &#038; Friends between November 1969 and March 1970. When the band broke up Gordon and Raddle joined Joe Cocker’s Mad Dogs and Englishmen tour while Whitlock returned to the States. By April 1970 Whitlock was back in the UK living at Clapton’s Surrey home and the pair of them were writing songs together. When the Cocker tour ended Gordon and Radle returned to England and together with Clapton and Whitlock they worked with George Harrison on his All Things Must Pass album. It was out of this that the four musicians began to build empathy that lead to them wanting to form a band. According to Bobby Whitlock: &#8220;We didn&#8217;t want any horns, we didn&#8217;t want no chicks, we wanted a rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll band. But my vocal concept was that we approach singing like Sam and Dave did: [Clapton] sings a line, I sing a line, we sing together.&#8221; During final rehearsals for the show, guitarist, Dave Mason, formerly with Traffic, was added to the band. Earlier in the day of their debut concert they band, that was still calling itself ‘Eric Clapton and friends’, a nod back to their time with Delaney &#038; Bonnie, were at Abbey Road for a Harrison session. They also recorded ‘Tell The Truth’ that became Derek and The Dominos first single when it was released in September 1970. The b-side of this single was ‘Roll It Over’, another recorded at an ATMP session and this included the former Beatle and Dave Mason of Traffic on guitar and vocals. Backstage at the Lyceum before the first show was George Harrison and Tony Ashton whose band was one of the others on the bill. A discussion took place involving the band, Harrison and Ashton and as Clapton recalls, it was Ashton that suggested &#8220;Del and the Dominos&#8221;, having taken to calling the guitarist &#8220;Derek&#8221; or &#8220;Del&#8221; since the Delaney &#038; Bonnie tour. However, according to Whitlock &#8220;the Dynamics&#8221; was the name they chose and that Ashton mispronounced it when introducing the band. In 2013, Clapton and Whitlock biographer Marc Roberty quotes London DJ, Jeff Dexter, who MC’d the Lyceum show, who recalled that &#8220;Derek and the Dominos&#8221; had already been decided on before they went on stage. Apparently Clapton really liked it while the other three, all Americans, thought they might be confused with a doo-wop group. It was not the band’s greatest gig that garnered some mixed reviews. Some of the UK’s music press were unable to come to terms with Eric as a singing front man. They wanted non-stop guitar pyrotechnics. Clapton’s memories of the gig, according to his autobiography, centred on his desire to win the affections of Patti Boyd. He was consulting New Orleans-born musician Dr John, a practitioner of voodoo who sent Eric a package made of straw that would help in his quest. Following their London debut the band spent time rehearsing before embarking on a UK tour that opened at The Village Blues club in Dagenham Essex, not one of Britain’s most prestigious venues. For the next 22 days they criss-crossed the country playing 18 gigs, ranging from London’s Speakeasy Club to The Black Prince Pub in Bexley Kent and The Penthouse in Scarborough in Yorkshire; there was even a side trip to Biot in France for a lone cross-channel gig. During July and while the band was touring, Robert Stigwood, the band’s manager, was busy arranging the band’s recording for their debut album. He called Tom Dowd who was working on The Allman Brothers sessions for Idlewild South and told him that the band wanted to come to Florida to record at Criteria Studios in Miami. At the press launch of Derek and the Dominos’ first single for Polydor in London, Stigwood handed a “Derek is Eric” badge to every journalist that attended…just to be sure.

Billy Ray Cyrus, the singer and actor from Flatwoods, Kentucky, had made his first-ever appearance on the Billboard 200 album chart only a week earlier, when his debut album ‘Some Gave All’ climbed to No. 1 on June 13, 1992. It was the beginning of an incredible, unbroken 17-week reign, and no artist has ever spent longer at the top with their first release. The album remained uncatchable all the way through to October, when it was unseated by another country phenomenon, Garth Brooks, with ‘The Chase.’ Soon afterwards, in November, ‘Some Gave All’ became the first debut set in country music history to ship five million units in America. Even that spectacular achievement was as nothing to what ‘Some Gave All’ would eventually achieve. Two months later, in January 1993, it hit six million shipments; in May, seven, and in November, eight. It reached nine million shipments in July, 1996. The album spent 43 weeks in the top ten, and 97 in the entire chart, and is the bestselling debut album by any solo artist in chart history. Worldwide sales of ‘Some Gave All’ now stand at some 20 million. Unlike the majority of US country stars, Cyrus’ music travelled well, if only for this heady year. Propelled by its massive flagship hit ‘Achy Breaky Heart,’ the album topped the charts in Australia (where it went triple platinum) and Canada, and reached No. 9 in the UK. It even made the top 40 in France. Listen to &#8216;Some Gave All&#8217; on Spotify]]></description>

The much-loved 70-year-old musician is being honoured for his key role in the development of the folk tradition as a founder member of three of the genre’s most seminal groups, Fairport Convention, Steeleye Span and the Albion Band. &#8220;I&#8217;m obviously very proud of this honour,” said 70-year-old Hutchings, who was born in London but now lives in Derbyshire. “But it&#8217;s England&#8217;s musical tradition that&#8217;s being recognised as much as me.&#8221; In a career of nearly 50 years, Hutchings’ work with Fairport, Steeleye, the Albion Band and others helped bring traditional music up to date and to a new, young audience by introducing rock instrumentation. He continues to be highly active with various recording and performing projects. In August, Talking Elephant will release his 17-track compilation ‘The Riot of Spring and Other Historical Dramas, Large and Small.’ Hutchings has also worked with Richard Thompson OBE (both in and out of Fairport), Maddy Prior MBE (both in and one of Steeleye), Martin Carthy MBE, Shirley Collins MBE, John Tams and the late Sandy Denny, who called Ashley “one of my biggest heroes, a great man.” The English musician worked with National Theatre director Bill Bryden in the 1970s, composing the music to &#8216;The Mysteries,’ &#8216;Lark Rise to Candleford&#8217; and &#8216;The World Turned Upside Down.’ He was commissioned by EMI to create an album of traditional dance tunes specifically aimed at schoolchildren, and he has conducted numerous workshops that have introduced young people to England&#8217;s folk song and dance. His previous awards include the English Folk Dance and Song Society&#8217;s Gold Badge Award, the Good Tradition Award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards and Lifetime Achievement Award at Italy&#8217;s Premio Ciampi. Fairport Convention’s landmark LP &#8216;Liege &#38; Lief&#8217; was voted The Most Influential Folk Album of All Time by listeners to BBC Radio 2.

            <description><![CDATA[<div><img width="150" height="150" src="http://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Somewhere-In-England-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Somewhere In England" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" /></div>In 1981, George Harrison was somewhere in England, or more specifically, in his home studio at Friar Park, Henley-on-Thames, making a new album at a relaxed pace — partly because he was becoming a little disillusioned with the state of the music business, and partly because, some of the time, he preferred gardening. “He’d garden at nighttime, until midnight,” said George’s son Dhani, in Olivia Harrison’s book ‘Living In The Material World.’ “He’d be out there squinting because he could see, at midnight, the moonlight and the shadows, and that was his way of not seeing the weeds or imperfections that would plague him during the day, so he could imagine what it would look like after it was done. He missed nearly every dinner because he was in the garden. He would be out there from first thing in the morning to last thing at night.” After his self-titled album of 1979, George set to work on what became the ‘Somewhere In England’ album quite quickly, and delivered it to Warner Brothers the following year. In what now seems a laughable judgement, they deemed some of the tracks unsuitable, and while George was hardly complimented by the ruling, he set back to work on the album towards the end of 1980. Ringo Starr, who had arrived to have some songs produced by George, was with him at Friar Park, just before a truly dreadful event took place. The murder of John Lennon in December that year moved George to return to his composition ‘All Those Years Ago’. He and Ringo had recorded the song in November with a view to its inclusion on Starr’s album, a set that was released as ‘Stop And Smell The Roses’ late in 1981. George was compelled to write a new, nostalgic and affectionate lyric as a tribute to John, and the song was re-cut with George singing lead, Ringo on drums, Paul and Linda McCartney on backing vocals, and appearances by friends such as Ray Cooper, Denny Laine, Al Kooper and Herbie Flowers. It was released ahead of George’s new album in May and became a fitting, and touching, success, spending three weeks at No. 2 in America. Exactly 34 years ago, ‘Somewhere In England,’ including ‘All Those Years Ago,’ made its UK debut at No. 13 on the chart of June 13, 1981. It spent a second week in the top 20 before descending. The LP made the American chart on June 20, climbing to No. 11 in a 13-week run. George was later obliged by the record company to change the original album cover, featuring an image of him overlaid on an aerial shot of the UK, to one of him standing in front of ‘Holland Park Avenue Study.’ The original cover was reinstated in the 2004 reissue that was part of the ‘Dark Horse Years’ box set. One of George’s favourites on the album was the opening track, the wry ‘Blood From A Clone.’ With his trademark dark humour, he observed the fact that some of his music was apparently no longer right for the times. &#8220;They say you like it, but knowing the market, it may not go well, it&#8217;s too laid back,” he sang. “You need some oom-pah-pah, nothing like Frank Zappa, and not new wave, they don&#8217;t play that crap…try beating your head on a brick wall, hard like a stone&#8230;don&#8217;t have time for the music, they want blood from a clone.” He later explained to Creem magazine: “That was all this stuff they were telling me: ‘Well, we like it, but we don&#8217;t really hear a single.’ And then other people were saying, ‘Now, look, radio stations are having all these polls done in the street to find out what constitutes a hit single and they&#8217;ve decided a hit single is a song of love gained or lost directed at 14-to-20-year-olds.’ And I said, ‘Shit, what chance does that give me?’ “So anyway, I went in and wrote that song just to shed some of the frustrations. And there&#8217;s things in there like ‘There is no sense to it, pure pounds and pence to it&#8230;They&#8217;re so intense, too, makes me amazed.’” 18 months later, George returned with ‘Gone Troppo,’ after which he wouldn’t be back with an album under his own name until the ‘Cloud Nine’ triumph of 1987.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Grand Funk’s rock anthem, and 1973 US pop No. 1 ‘We’re An American Band,’ has a new starring role on network television — as the music behind a new Fox Sports trailer for its US Open golf tournament coverage. The 115th Open takes place between June 18 and 21. The trailer is part of the network’s $15 million marketing campaign for its coverage of the famous event. The clip begins with President John F. Kennedy in golfing action, playing a shot at Hyannisport Club in 1963. It also includes footage of Elvis Presley to a voiceover that says “Like rebels and rock ‘n’ roll, it’s become a stage for greatness.” “This is not only one of the biggest marketing events in the history of Fox Sports, but it may well be the biggest in the history of the US Open,&#8221; Robert Gottlieb, executive VP of marketing for Fox Sports Media Group, told Ad Age. ‘We’re An American Band,’ which holds a place in the Rock &#38; Roll Hall of Fame, was GFR’s first hit as Grand Funk, after they dropped the ‘Railroad’ from their name. Four years after their first Hot 100 entry with ‘Time Machine,’ it was also their first No. 1 single, topping the chart for a week at the end of September, 1973. The trio from Flint, Michigan had a second No. 1 the following year with their cover of Little Eva’s ‘The Loco-Motion.’ Explore our dedicated Grand Funk Railroad Artist Page]]></description>
