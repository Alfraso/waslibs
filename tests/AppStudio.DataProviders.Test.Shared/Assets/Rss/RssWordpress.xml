                <![CDATA[<p>Oregon’s pristine waters make it a paradise for fishers, boaters and adventure-seekers. Whether you aim to hook a record-breaking sturgeon or just want to enjoy a lazy afternoon on the river, these four waterways — all less than an hour away from Portland — provide the perfect setting for your next fish tale.</p>
<h3><strong>Clackamas River</strong></h3>
<p>Popular with whitewater rafters and other river-floaters, the Clackamas flows through miles of rugged mountainous terrain and towering forests. The river’s native runs of coho and Chinook salmon, summer and winter steelhead, and multiple types of trout draw year-round interest from anglers. The closest boat ramp, <a href="http://www.clackamas.us/parks/carver.html" target="_blank">Carver Park</a>, sits only 20 miles (32 km) southeast of Portland in historic Oregon City. For more solitude, bank fishers also favor <a title="Milo McIver State Park" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/milo-mciver-state-park/">Milo McIver State Park </a>near Estacada.</p>
<h3><strong>Sandy River </strong></h3>
<p>On sunny summer days, the gentle Sandy attracts a mix of inner-tubers, kayakers and rafters, along with fly and bait fishers. Reel in abundant populations of winter steelhead, cutthroat and rainbow trout, and coho and Chinook salmon in <a href="http://www.ci.troutdale.or.us/parks-facilities/documents/glennottopark.htm" target="_blank">Glen Otto City Park</a><strong>. </strong>Located just 20 minutes east of Portland in the town of Troutdale, this leafy oasis also boasts a swimming beach, playground, picnic area and other family-friendly amenities.</p>
<h3><strong>Willamette River </strong></h3>
<p>Best known for bisecting Portland into east and west sides (and thus necessitating the city’s famous bridges), the Willamette River is one of only a handful of U.S. rivers to offer salmon and steelhead fishing in a large metropolitan area.</p>
<p>Boaters can often be spotted drifting beneath the bridges in search of other species like sturgeon, shad and smallmouth bass. For a unique experience, try casting a line from the <a title="Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/vera-katz-eastbank-esplanade/">Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade</a>, a floating walkway tucked between the Hawthorne and Steel bridges in downtown Portland or head to <a href="http://www.oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&amp;parkId=101" target="_blank">Mary S. Young Park</a> in West Linn, where bank fishers will find seasonal access to Cedar Island.</p>
<h3> <strong>Wilson River</strong></h3>
<p>Stretching 33 miles (53 km) from the Northern Oregon Coast range to Tillamook Bay, the Wilson River is known as one of the state’s best spots for steelhead and Chinook salmon. The river flows west through the <a title="Tillamook State Forest" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/tillamook-state-forest/">Tillamook State Forest</a>, where several campgrounds and day-use areas provide anglers with easy river access. Don’t miss a visit to the <a title="Tillamook Forest Center" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/tillamook-forest-center/">Tillamook Forest Center</a>, only an hour west of Portland, home to a replica 40-foot-tall (12 m) fire lookout tower and a network of hiking trails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re heading out on the river to catch your dinner, check the state&#8217;s <a href="https://public.health.oregon.gov/HealthyEnvironments/Recreation/FishConsumption/Pages/index.aspx">fish consumption guidelines and resources</a>.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Home to a crowd of craft distilleries, urban wineries and more breweries than any other city on earth, Portland has no shortage of world-class watering holes. And when the weather warms and the days grow long, imbibers flock to these picturesque bar patios to pair a shot of sunshine with their summer drinks of choice.</p>
<h3>North Portland</h3>
<p>Hip Mississippi Avenue offers a handful of top-notch patios. Order grass-fed cheeseburgers at roomy picnic tables and buy pints from an outdoor order window at <a title="Mississippi Studios &amp; Bar Bar" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/mississippi-studios-bar-bar/">Bar Bar</a>, then catch a live show at adjoining <a title="Mississippi Studios &amp; Bar Bar" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/mississippi-studios-bar-bar/">Mississippi Studios</a>. Down the street, locals cheer on the Portland Timbers with Cloud Ripper IPAs at <a title="StormBreaker Brewing" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/stormbreaker-brewing/">StormBreaker Brewery</a>, where outdoor seating options include a large tented area outfitted with a TV projector. For a quick European getaway, check out <a title="Prost!" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/prost/">Prost!</a>, an authentic German beer hall with a spacious back porch, where patrons pair imported <em>bier</em> with traditional bratwurst and Bavarian pretzels.</p>
<p>A few blocks east on the popular cycling corridor Williams Avenue, <a href="http://vendettapdx.com/" target="_blank">Vendetta</a> offers a gigantic back patio with Zen-inspired landscaping, hanging lights and plenty of tables. Hungry? Nearby, <a href="http://www.thewaypost.com/" target="_blank">The Waypost</a> serves “Arizona-themed” fare like plantain tacos and habanero lime margaritas in a patio space that doubles as a community garden.</p>
<h3><strong>Northeast Portland</strong></h3>
<p>The rooftop garden at <a title="Noble Rot" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/noble-rot/">Noble Rot</a> provides the Central Eastside restaurant with some of freshest organic veggies in town — and the fourth-floor view’s not bad, either. Grab a seat outside and enjoy views of the sun dipping behind downtown Portland and the woodsy West Hills. Not to be outdone, Alberta Street’s <a href="http://www.radioroompdx.com/" target="_blank">Radio Room</a> offers two airy options: an adults-only rooftop outfitted with heaters and a wood-burning fireplace, and a family- (and canine-) friendly street-level garden warmed by a gas fire pit.</p>
<p>On Mondays, picnic tables in front of <a title="Migration Brewing" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/migration-brewing/">Migration Brewing</a> are in high demand thanks to $3 microbrews; order a flagship Migration Pale Ale and settle in for some quality people-watching.</p>
<h3><strong>Southeast Portland</strong></h3>
<p>Summer means frequent dance parties and live band performances on the back patio at <a title="White Owl Social Club" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/white-owl-social-club/">White Owl Social Club</a>. The menu boasts a great selection of gluten-free and vegan grub, and revelers can even roast s’mores on tabletop campfires. Outdoorsy types also love <a title="Base Camp Brewing" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/base-camp-brewing/">Base Camp Brewing</a>, where the vibe includes outdoor fire pits, tree stump chairs and well-rounded beers like the “In-Tents” India Pale Lager.</p>
<p>For a boot-scootin’ time, grab your cowboy hat (or trucker cap) and drop into the <a title="Landmark Saloon" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/landmark-saloon/">Landmark Saloon</a> to play backyard cornhole and horseshoes accompanied by live honky-tonk tunes. Pulled pork po’boys from Leroy’s BBQ food cart keeps the crowds well fed. Super picky about your beer? <a title="Apex" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/apex/">Apex </a>keeps 50 drafts on tap — and about that many picnic tables out front.</p>
<p>Named one of the <a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/slideshows/best-grilled-cheese-in-the-us#!slide=15">country’s best grilled cheese sandwiches</a> by <em>Food &amp; Wine</em>, the bacon-and-Fontina sando is reason enough to visit <a title="EastBurn" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/eastburn/">EastBurn</a>. The cozy fireside tables and quirky swinging chairs only add to the appeal.</p>
<h3><strong>Southwest Portland</strong></h3>
<p>Perched atop the 15th floor of the Nines Hotel, the rooftop bar at <a title="Departure" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/departure/">Departure</a><b> </b>boasts panoramic views of downtown, including an aerial view of “Portland’s Living Room” (aka <a title="Pioneer Courthouse Square" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/pioneer-courthouse-square/">Pioneer Courthouse Square</a>). Settle into the comfy outdoor couches and order Asian-inspired small plates prepared by Top Chef finalist Gregory Gourdet. Another happy hour favorite, <a title="Nel Centro" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/nel-centro/">Nel Centro</a> features a mod courtyard with a black marble fire pit and an artsy “living wall” of lush greenery.</p>
<h3><strong>Northwest Portland</strong></h3>
<p><a title="On Deck Sports Bar &amp; Grill" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/deck-sports-bar-grill/">On Deck Sports Bar and Grill </a>claims the title of neighborhood’s largest outdoor patio, offering cool summer breezes and hi-def coverage of the day’s top athletic events. For more sophisticated pub grub, peruse a long list of Belgian beers, gourmet small plates like mussels and frites, and more than 150 whiskeys at <a title="North 45" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/north-45/">North 45</a>, whose tucked away brick- and tree-lined patio feels like it was transported from a town square in Brussels.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Every day is <a href="http://www.recordstoreday.com/Venues?state=OR" target="_blank">Record Store Day</a> in Portland, where indie bands rule the airwaves and mom-and-pop music vinyl shops still line neighborhood streets. From vintage wax to new European imports, those rare releases you’ve been searching for are surely waiting at one of these rockin’ local record stores:</p>
<h4><strong>SOUTHEAST</strong>:</h4>
<p>Portland’s oldest music store, <a title="Music Millennium" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/music-millennium/">Music Millennium, </a>opened in 1969 with a mission to stock the kind of underground tunes absent from the racks of mainstream department stores of the era. To the delight of audiophiles, not much has changed. Multiple rooms stash untold tuneful treasures, from bargain bins of used CDs and vinyl to collector rarities — a first pressing of <em>Led Zeppelin I</em> recently sold for $1,000. Looking for live music? Touring bands often drop by the shop for free shows.</p>
<p><a title="Crossroads Music" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/crossroads-music/">Crossroads Music</a> works like a melodic consignment shop, divvying up the catalog of more than 35 individual record collectors. The deep well of musical tastes results in an impressive selection of quality vinyl inside this Hawthorne Boulevard gem. Spend an afternoon browsing bins of prog-rock, post-punk, classic rock and more, and don’t miss the killer assortment of vintage concert posters.</p>
<h4><strong>NORTH: </strong></h4>
<p>Mississippi Avenue’s <a href="http://www.wearebeaconsound.com/" target="_blank">Beacon Sound</a> carries new and used records across all genres, but many locals consider it the best place for contemporary electronic and avant garde imports. Sharing space with contemporary art gallery FISK, the sleek shop evokes a museum feel and features frequent collaborations with local artists celebrating music, art and design.</p>
<p>Just up the street, owner Eric Isaacson maintains a meticulously curated assemblage of rare releases at celebrated <a title="Mississippi Records" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/mississippi-records/">Mississippi Records,</a> named one of the <a href="http://experience.usatoday.com/weekend/story/lifestyle/2014/05/20/10-best-record-stores-in-america/9332657/">nation’s top 10 record stores</a> by <em>USA Today</em>. Finds include old-timey gospel, blues, folk and pre-Beatles rock, as well as contemporary albums released under the shop’s namesake record label. (Not in Portland? Local <a href="http://www.littleaxerecords.com/" target="_blank">Little Axe Records</a> is the label’s online distributor.)</p>
<h4><strong>SOUTHWEST:</strong></h4>
<p>What’s even more exciting than the enormous selection at <a title="Everyday Music" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/everyday-music/">Everyday Music</a>? Its scrupulous organizational system, surprisingly rare among independent record stores. The mammoth West Burnside Street mainstay keeps its vast vinyl collection impeccably sorted and neatly labeled, letting customers use the time they’d usually spend digging through jumbled boxes to listen to groovy tunes instead. Stop by the shop’s second storefront on Northeast Sandy Boulevard for even more musical selection.</p>
<p>Crowds of pierced teens and graying rockers find common ground at popular <a title="2nd Avenue Records" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/2nd-avenue-records/">2nd Avenue Records</a>, where stacks of used hip-hop and hardcore punk albums draw devoted fans. A downtown fixture for more than 30 years, the shop has a massive metal collection, rivaled only by its robust collection of vintage band tees.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Portland is known for its stellar craft brewing scene, with more breweries in its city limits than anywhere else in the world. While most adults are happy to sample the sudsy scene, their kids might not be so keen. Never fear, parents with children in tow: Plenty of Portland pubs don’t just tolerate youngsters, they welcome them with open arms.</p>
<p>In Northeast Portland, spacious <a title="Old Town Brewing Co." href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/old-town-pizza-eastside/">Old Town Brewing</a> offers perennial kid-favorite pizza along with award-winning beers. Featuring both a parking lot and two floors of seating, Old Town is a good bet for parents seeking a family-friendly neighborhood brewpub.</p>
<p><a title="Laurelwood Brewing" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/laurelwood-brewing/">Laurelwood Brewing</a> describes itself as “the place where friends and family meet,” and they’re serious about the family part. Being kid-friendly is an integral part of the brewery’s philosophy (it was opened by parents with young children) and each of their locations, including the brewery on Northeast Sandy Boulevard and the <a title="Laurelwood Brewing (Sellwood)" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/laurelwood-brewing-sellwood/">Sellwood brewpub</a>, features a play area specially designed for toddlers.</p>
<p>Both <a title="Hopworks Urban Brewery" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/hopworks-urban-brewery/">Hopworks Urban Brewery</a>, in Southeast Portland, and <a title="Hopworks BikeBar" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/hopworks-bikebar/">Hopworks BikeBar</a>, on North Williams Avenue, cater to kids and beer-lovers alike. One of Portland’s most popular breweries for all audiences, Hopworks earns rave reviews from families for its play areas, equipped with toys and books, and a kids’ menu with local and organic ingredients. Once every month, each location even hosts a free family event with a seasonal craft activity, story time and fresh, healthy snack: Tot Tuesday on the second Tuesday of the month at Hopworks on Powell and Tot Thursday on the second Thursday at Hopworks BikeBar.</p>
<p>The country’s first nonprofit brewery, <a title="Ex Novo Brewing" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/ex-novo-brewing/">Ex Novo Brewing</a>, has a dozen house beers on tap plus a deluxe restroom changing station equipped with diapers and wipes, making it a great stop for community-minded parents. <a title="Oregon Public House" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/oregon-public-house/">Oregon Public House</a> (home of Aletruism Brewing) is the first nonprofit pub of its kind, allowing patrons to choose where their individual proceeds are donated. Local charities benefit from the 100% of the pub’s net profits, while families benefit from its relaxed atmosphere and kids’ play area.</p>
<p>When <a title="McMenamins Kennedy School" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/mcmenamins-kennedy-school/">McMenamins Kennedy School</a> first opened in 1915, it was literally built for children. That’s because it was originally an elementary school that sat vacant for years before being converted into a family-friendly brewpub and hotel in 1997. Some of the 57 guestrooms feature original cloak closets and blackboards, but the biggest draws for kids are the on-site movie theater and warm, shallow soaking pool; parents will enjoy the six restaurants and bars on the premises.</p>

<p>Dan Rebellato’s drama starts with a compilation tape left by Sara’s husband, Chris, which she discovers after he dies. But by the end of his life, Chris was profoundly deaf, so what to make of this tape, how to interpret it? Rebellato wrote the play to be performed in both English and sign language.</p>

<h4>through May 23</h4>
<h4><a title="Milagro – Miracle Theatre Group" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/miracle-theatre-group/">Milagro Theatre</a></h4>
<p>Richard Montoya’s play was developed at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, and it’s a surrealistic and pointed trip through American history as dreamed and considered by an immigrant studying for his citizenship exam. Montoya is part of satirical troupe Culture Clash, so the play has slapstick comic elements and a keen sense of the absurd, and it’s an excellent vehicle for Portland’s central Hispanic theater company.</p>

<p>Amy Herzog’s Pulitzer finalist is a family comedy/drama with lots of twists and turns, which begin when Leo arrives at his grandmother’s West Village apartment unannounced after a cross-country bike trip. She’s not your typical grandmother, as Leo discovers — both to his discomfort and his enlightenment. Herzog’s career is on a steep upward trajectory and Artists Rep will help you catch a ride.</p>

<h4><a title="Portland Center Stage – Gerding Theater" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/portland-center-stage-gerding-theater/">Portland Center Stage</a></h4>
<p>Benjamin Scheuer’s autobiographical coming-of-age story is also one-man musical, written and performed by Scheuer, who is touring it after several successful New York engagements. Although Scheuer is an engaging performer in the folkie vein, all is not sweetness and butterflies in <em>The Lion</em> — it’s mostly about his struggle to deal with his unhappy father. Center Stage has done well with its one-performer shows in the past, and this one should continue the string.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.octc.org/onstage/ramona" target="_blank">Ramona Quimby</a></h2>
<h4>May 9–31</h4>

<p>Beverly Cleary wrote the delightful Ramona Quimby series of children’s books with Northeast Klickitat Street in Portland in mind, and Oregon Children’s Theatre has visited the neighborhood before. But really, each generation deserves a fresh look at Ramona, Beezus and company, and so do those of us who want to visit them again.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.portlandopera.org/production/the-phantom-of-the-opera/" target="_blank">Phantom of the Opera</a></h2>
<h4>May 13–23</h4>
<h4><a title="Portland Opera" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/portland-operafred-meyer-broadway-across-america-portland/">Portland Opera</a> at <a title="Keller Auditorium" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/keller-auditorium/">Keller Auditorium</a></h4>
<p>This revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s massively successful musical was redesigned quite a bit for its opening in London, but all of its primary charms remain the same — the songs, the man in the mask, the beautiful object of his affection and, of course, the chandelier. Portland has been a hotbed of “Phantom” enthusiasts and has always figured in its national tours.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.portlandplayhouse.org/mr-burns-a-post-electric-play/" target="_blank">Mr. Burns: A post-electric play</a></h2>
<h4>May 13–June 7</h4>
<h4><a title="Portland Playhouse" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/portland-playhouse/">Portland Playhouse</a></h4>
<p>A band of survivors gathers around the campfire as usual and start telling stories that keep them going in the post-apocalyptic future. And what sorts of tales do they tell? Episodes from the <em>The Simpsons</em>, of course, in Anne Washburn’s brilliant comedy. It’s fitting that this play get a production in Portland, given that creator Matt Groening grew up here, and the intimate confines of Portland Playhouse should create the perfect atmosphere for it.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.pcs.org/threedays/" target="_blank">Three Days of Rain</a></h2>
<h4>May 17–June 21</h4>
<h4><a title="Portland Center Stage – Gerding Theater" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/portland-center-stage-gerding-theater/">Portland Center Stage</a></h4>
<p>Richard Greenberg’s 1997 play is a tour de force of theatrical language and Greenberg’s exploration of the existential dilemmas that befuddle and obsess us, even through the generations, so a production of <em>Three Days of Rain</em> is always welcome. Center Stage’s version will be especially interesting to fans of the filmed-in-Portland TV drama <em>Grimm</em>, because of two of its stars, Silas Weir Mitchell (Monroe) and Sasha Roiz (Captain Renard), feature in the production. Tickets will go fast, so act quickly.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.bodyvox.com/performance/cosmosis" target="_blank">Cosmosis</a></h2>
<h4>May 21–June 6</h4>
<h4><a title="BodyVox Dance Company" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/bodyvox-dance-company/">BodyVox</a></h4>
<p>BodyVox’s artistic directors, Jamie Hampton and Ashley Roland, are veteran and inveterate collaborators, using the talents of musicians and videographers to propel their very theatrical dance performances to new heights. For <em>Cosmosis</em>, they’ve enlisted the fine Amphion String Quartet to fuel the creative fire; you’ll find film, movement and music mixed together.</p>

<h4><a title="Artists Repertory Theatre" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/artists-repertory-theatre/" target="_blank">Artists Repertory Theatre</a></h4>
<p>For its last show of the season, Artists Rep takes on David Ives’ delightful adaptation of Corneille’s 17th-century French farce. Ives is a modern master of comic repartee, which makes the pairing especially delicious, and the cast is made up of Artists Rep regulars and directed by artistic director Damaso Rodriguez.</p>
<h2><a href="http://profiletheatre.org/2015/in-the-next-room-or-the-vibrator-play/" target="_blank">In the Next Room, or the vibrator play</a></h2>
<h4>June 11–28</h4>
<h4><a title="Profile Theatre" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/profile-theatre/">Profile Theatre</a></h4>
<p>Profile devotes its season to a single playwright, and this year the company has selected Sarah Ruhl, the comic genius behind this play, in which Victorian ladies suffering from “hysteria” receive relief from the electrical ministrations of a kindly doctor. Sometimes, it seems, what’s good for the body is good for the mind!</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.nwdanceproject.org/shows" target="_blank">Summer Splendors</a></h2>

<p>Dedicated to introducing brand-new dance works, the Northwest Dance Project’s programs are usually loaded with world premieres, and this concert is no exception. New dances by company artistic director and founder Sarah Slipper, Lucas Crandall, Rachel Erdos and Tracey Durbin will feature the company’s skilled dancers and performers from Chamber Music Northwest, one of the country’s top chamber music festivals.</p>

<h4>May 1, 7:30 p.m.</h4>
<h4><a title="Third Angle New Music" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/third-angle-new-music/">Third Angle New Music</a> at <a title="Alberta Rose Theatre" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/alberta-rose-theatre/">Alberta Rose Theater</a></h4>
<p>The veteran contemporary music ensemble brings in <em>New Yorker</em> classical music critic and author Alex Ross to curate and host a conversation about West Coast classical music. The program includes music from the 1930s to the 21st century by the pioneering California composer Henry Cowell, his students Lou Harrison (from Portland) and John Cage, the original DIY eccentric Harry Partch (who designed and built his own instruments in strange yet enchanting tunings), Harrison’s protégé (and 2014 Pulitzer Prize winner) John Luther Adams, and more.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.portlandopera.org/production/show-boat/" target="_blank">Show Boat</a></h2>
<h4>May 1–9</h4>
<h4><a title="Portland Opera" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/portland-operafred-meyer-broadway-across-america-portland/">Portland Opera</a> at <a title="Keller Auditorium" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/keller-auditorium/">Keller Auditorium</a></h4>
<p>The Portland premiere of director Harold Prince’s award-winning 1994 version of Jerome Kern’s groundbreaking 1927 musical deals with issues of racial and economic injustice that still resonate today. Along with immortal songs like “Ol’ Man River” and “Can’t Help Lovin’ That Man,” Portland Opera’s production includes various community events and discussions about the show’s still-relevant themes. The cast features familiar Portland actors and singers (Allen Nause, Susannah Mars, Hannah Penn, Lindsay Ohse) along with national stars (Liam Bonner, Angela Renee Simpson, Arthur Woodley).</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.portlandyouthphil.org" target="_blank">Spring Concert</a></h2>
<h4>May 3, 4 p.m.</h4>
<h4>Portland Youth Philharmonic at <a title="Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/arlene-schnitzer-concert-hall/">Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall</a></h4>
<p>The teenage winners of PYP’s 2015 Soloist Competition star in a celebration of 20th-century American music. Cellist Annie Zhang plays Tchaikovsky, trombonist Spencer Schaffer takes the lead in José Berghmans’ <em>The Bearded Lady</em>, and the award-winning orchestra also performs a pair of World War II-era American classics: Walter Piston’s 1944 Symphony #2 and Aaron Copland’s delightful 1938 ballet score <em>Billy the Kid</em>.</p>
<h2><a href="http://tickets.orsymphony.org/single/psDetail.aspx?psn=2543" target="_blank">Sax and the Symphony</a></h2>
<h4>May 9–11, 8 p.m.</h4>
<h4><a title="Oregon Symphony" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/oregon-symphony/">Oregon Symphony</a> with James Carter at <a title="Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/arlene-schnitzer-concert-hall/">Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall</a></h4>
<p>The orchestra brings in one of jazz’s greatest living saxmen in a concert of 20th-century American music. One of America’s leading composers, Roberto Sierra, wrote his 2002 <em>Concerto for Saxophones</em> for Carter, who’ll display his usual mastery on both tenor and soprano saxes. The splendid program also boasts another strong contemporary American work, Christopher Rouse’s <em>Concerto for Orchestra</em>, and a pair of familiar 20th-century U.S. classics: Samuel Barber’s poignant <em>Adagio</em> for strings, and the <em>Symphonic Dances</em> Leonard Bernstein drew from his immortal <em>West Side Story</em> score.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.fearnomusic.org/concerts/2014-15/43" target="_blank">New American Classics</a></h2>
<h4>May 16</h4>
<h4>FearNoMusic at <a title="Mississippi Studios &amp; Bar Bar" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/mississippi-studios-bar-bar/">Mississippi Studios</a></h4>
<p>Despite what the repertoire of most chamber music groups and festivals would suggest, classics are still being made. We won’t know for years whether the three excellent works by esteemed 21st-century American composers on this program — Joan Tower&#8217;s <em>Wild Purple</em> for solo viola, Stephen Harke&#8217;s piano quartet <em>King of the Sun</em> and Osvaldo Golijov&#8217;s <em>The Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind</em> for string quartet and Klezmer clarinet — will rise to that exalted level, but they’re all worth hearing right here and now.</p>

<h4>May 17, 2 p.m. at <a title="Trinity Episcopal Cathedral" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/trinity-episcopal-cathedral/">Trinity Episcopal Cathedral</a></h4>
<p>Esteemed British composer Ivan Moody conducts Portland’s stellar vocal ensemble in rarely heard contemporary European choral works. Moody, an expert on the music of Alfred Schnittke, leads 26 singers in a performance of the great 20th-century Russian composer’s powerful <em>Verses of Repentance</em> (<em>Stikhi Pokayanniye</em>), along with a piece by Galina Grigorjeva and his own <em>Anastasis</em> setting of Eastertide texts in Greek and English.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.psuchamberchoir.com/events.html" target="_blank">The Little Match Girl Passion</a></h2>

<h4>Portland State Chamber Choir at <a title="St. Stephen Catholic Church" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/st-stephen-catholic-church/">St. Stephen’s Catholic Church</a></h4>
<p>The international award-winning student choir sings a dramatic version of the 2008 Pulitzer Prize-winning composition. Ethan Sperry leads the Portland premiere of the stark, haunting setting of Hans Christian Andersen’s poignant tale of childhood poverty composed by one of today’s leading composers and the co-founder of New York’s groundbreaking Bang on a Can collective, David Lang.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.portlandopera.org/production/the-rakes-progress/" target="_blank">The Rake’s Progress</a></h2>
<h4>June 11–14</h4>
<h4><a title="Portland Opera" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/portland-operafred-meyer-broadway-across-america-portland/">Portland Opera</a> at <a title="Keller Auditorium" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/keller-auditorium/">Keller Auditorium</a></h4>
<p>The Portland premiere of Igor Stravinsky’s only opera features the great English-Californian artist David Hockney’s dazzling sets and visuals, in conjunction with the Portland Art Museum’s Hockney exhibit. Stravinsky based his sly, 1951 deal-with-the-devil tale on a series of famous 18th-century paintings by William Hogarth, so it’s only fitting that it really came alive in Hockney’s 1975 vision, which is still delighting audiences. This production stars tenor Jonathan Boyd as Tom Rakewell, soprano Maureen Mckay as Anne Trulove, Portland’s Angela Niederloh as Baba the Turk and David Pittsinger as Nick Shadow.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.resonancechoral.org/current-season" target="_blank">War and Peace</a></h2>
<h4>June 13, 7:30 p.m.</h4>
<h4>Resonance Ensemble at <a title="Lincoln Recital Hall" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/lincoln-recital-hall/">Lincoln Recital Hall</a></h4>
<p>One of the city’s finest choral groups sings a pair of 20th-century masterpieces. Ravaged by conflict, Europe produced powerful musical works on the themes of peace and war. One of Arnold Schoenberg’s last works before he moved into atonality, the short 1907 “Peace on Earth,” sets a text by a Swiss poet, while Francis Poulenc’s powerful World War II choral cantata Figure Humaine (“The Human Face”), dedicated to Picasso,  was written at some risk during the Nazi-fied Vichy regime in occupied Paris.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.makemusicdaypdx.org" target="_blank">Make Music PDX</a></h2>
<h4>June 21</h4>
<h4>Various venues and performers</h4>
<p>Portland joins more than 725 cities around the world to celebrate <a title="Make Music Day" href="http://makemusicday.org/" target="_blank">Make Music Day</a>. In the local version of a worldwide event that originated in France in 1982, musicians of every genre and those beyond categorization — amateur and professional alike — will be playing free solstice shows in parks, stores and other places around the city.</p>
<h2><a href="http://cmnw.org/concerts-tickets/2015-summer-festival/" target="_blank">Summer Festival</a></h2>
<h4>June 22–July 26</h4>
<h4><a title="Chamber Music Northwest" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/chamber-music-northwest/">Chamber Music Northwest</a>, various venues</h4>
<p>The annual summer festival again brings renowned classical musicians to Portland. The June shows feature a tribute to Brahms, a collaboration with <a title="Northwest Dance Project" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/northwest-dance-project/">Northwest Dance Project</a>, contemporary tango music, a collaboration with the <a title="Oregon Bach Festival" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/oregon-bach-festival/">Oregon Bach Festival</a> featuring <a title="Portland Baroque Orchestra" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/portland-baroque-orchestra/">Portland Baroque Orchestra</a> violinist Monica Huggett in a Beethoven tribute, and the young Jasper String Quartet performing the West Coast premiere of award-winning American composer Aaron Jay Kernis’s new string quartet, <em>River</em>.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.makrokosmosproject.org" target="_blank">Makrokosmos Project</a></h2>

<h4>DUO Stephanie and Saar at <a title="Blue Sky Gallery / Oregon Center for the Photographic Arts" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/blue-sky-gallery-oregon-center-for-the-photographic-arts/">Blue Sky Gallery</a></h4>
<p>The duo pianists, frequent visitors to Portland, join local musicians (including members of Third Angle and FearNoMusic) to perform the first two parts of the great American composer George Crumb’s masterpiece Makrokosmos for Amplified Piano, music by Portland’s own Kenji Bunch, two-piano works that include a world premiere by Crumb’s former student Gerald Levinson and music by George’s son David Crumb (a University of Oregon professor), and more.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.pianopushplay.com/events/2015/6/26/summer-kick-off-concert" target="_blank">Piano! Push Play!</a></h2>
<h4>June 26</h4>
<h4><a title="Portland Art Museum" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/portland-art-museum/">Portland Art Museum</a></h4>
<p>The summer event that invites the public to play pianos outdoors returns. The organization devoted to putting music making in everyone’s hands sponsors this free, all-day kickoff event featuring 10 pianos (and many more pianists) arrayed outside the Portland Art Museum. Among the many pieces performed will be an original composition from PSU composer Richie Greene for five hands. The instruments will then be distributed throughout the city for performances all summer.</p>

                <![CDATA[<h2><a href="http://fourteen30.com/Exhibits.cfm" target="_blank">Blair Saxon-Hill</a></h2>
<h4>through May 17</h4>
<h4><a title="Fourteen30 Contemporary Gallery" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/fourteen30-contemporary-gallery/">Fourteen30 Contemporary</a></h4>
<p>Portland artist Blair Saxon-Hill is known for her minimalistic forays into sculpture, collage and painting. Equally at home with rough-hewn natural materials as she is with found objects and altered books, Saxon-Hill’s work references familiar forms. In her use of cut book pages, photogravures and abstract appropriations, she hints at the disparate but tranquil juxtapositions in her sculptural practice.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.elizabethleach.com/Exhibit_Detail.cfm?ShowsID=287" target="_blank">PICA: Celebrating 20 Years: Reflecting on the First Decade</a></h2>
<h4>May 7–June 27</h4>
<h4><a title="Elizabeth Leach Gallery" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/elizabeth-leach-gallery/">Elizabeth Leach Gallery</a></h4>
<p>Celebrating the founding of the <a title="Portland Institute for Contemporary Art (PICA)" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/portland-institute-for-contemporary-art-pica/">Portland Institute for Contemporary Art</a> in 1995, this show presents more than 20 artists who were involved in the first 10 years of this thriving Portland mainstay. As a hotbed for experimentation in the visual and performing arts, PICA has been involved with groundbreaking artists both local and international. Among the works presented are those by Shirin Neshat, Anish Kapoor, Dinh Q. Lê, Jim Hodges, Francis Alÿs and more.</p>
<h2><a href="http://hapgallery.com/" target="_blank">August Muth: LIGHT-MIND</a></h2>
<h4>May 7–30</h4>
<h4>Hap Gallery, 916 N.W. Flanders St.</h4>
<p>Working with holographic processes and an intense interest in the effects of light, August Muth creates moving compositions. Truly based upon your own perception of the work’s surface, these glowing, flickering planes are at once ghostly and striking. Confusing the notions of time and space through his building of ephemeral layers, Muth asks us to question our daily experiences with light and how they affect our understanding of the unknown.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.carlsloan.com/" target="_blank">Tiffany Calvert</a></h2>
<h4>May 8–31</h4>
<h4>Carl &amp; Sloan, 8371 N. Interstate Ave.</h4>
<p>In the gallery’s first solo exhibition, Tiffany Calvert presents a selection of new works that tread the line between representation and abstraction. Drawing equally from art historical sources and journalistic photographs, the artist’s energetically obscure paintings question the nature of images as referential materials and historical sources.</p>
<h2><a href="http://portlandartmuseum.org/exhibitions/aiweiwei/" target="_blank">Ai Weiwei: Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads: Gold</a></h2>
<h4>May 23–Sept. 13</h4>
<h4><a title="Portland Art Museum" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/portland-art-museum/">Portland Art Museum</a></h4>
<p>As one of the most visible and controversial international figures of the last decade, Chinese artist Ai Weiwei has made a lasting impact on art world. The <a title="Portland Art Museum" href="http://www.travelportland.com/article/portland-art-museum/">Portland Art Museum</a> presentation of his <em>Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads: Gold</em> is a coup for Portland, and brings with it a discussion of history, repatriation and international affairs. The dozen gold-gilt bronzes will be on display this summer in the Arlene and Harold Schnitzer Sculpture Court.</p>
<h2><a href="http://pdxcontemporaryart.com/entwined-sound-installation" target="_blank">Ethan Rose: Entwined</a></h2>
<h4>June 2–27</h4>
<h4><a title="PDX Contemporary Art" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/pdx-contemporary-art/">PDX Contemporary Art</a></h4>
<p>Ethan Rose has a way with sound. He can transform a space into a chamber for listening and experiencing, or into an instrument that vibrates and chimes as you walk through it. As the speakers pulsate, their rhythms are transformed into physical motion in the strings stretched across the gallery. A series of drawings derived from these same vibrations accompanies the installation.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.froelickgallery.com/Exhibit_Detail.cfm?ShowsID=243" target="_blank">Rick Bartow: Horizon with Crow</a></h2>
<h4>June 2–July 18</h4>
<h4><a title="Froelick Gallery" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/froelick-gallery/">Froelick Gallery</a></h4>
<p>Coinciding with Rick Bartow’s retrospective at the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art in Eugene, this exhibition includes new paintings by one of the Northwest’s most preeminent artists. Drawing on his Native American heritage as well as mythic transformation stories from around the world, Bartow has constructed a striking iconography that uses natural and animal forms as freely as personal histories and portraiture.</p>
<h2><a href="http://adamsandollman.com/" target="_blank">Joan Nelson and Joseph Yoakum</a></h2>
<h4>June 4–July 11</h4>

<p>The landscapes in this two-person exhibition span the 20th century and jump headlong into the 21st. Both a result of recollection and invention as much as observation of actual locales, Joan Nelson and Joseph Yoakum’s works subvert the traditional genre into a much more personal mode. Nelson’s compositions spring from life and are colored with an attempt to convey the majesty of Oregon, while Yoakum’s look back on a lifetime as a traveler and are equal parts myth and memory.</p>

<p>In these twin exhibitions, Laura Russo Gallery presents new work by Roll Hardy and a selected retrospective of longtime Oregon artist Mel Katz. Hardy’s paintings take the derelict vistas of industrial areas and transform them into urban landscapes full of a sense of history and memory. On the other side of the show, Katz’s anodized aluminum works tread the line between minimal graphic works and bold forays into sculptural abstraction. His new work here supplements a major retrospective at the Hallie Ford Museum of Art in Salem.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>When you ask outdoorsy Portland locals where they&#8217;re headed on a summer day, chances are good they&#8217;ll answer, &#8220;The Willamette.&#8221; The river, which bisects the city into east and west sides, is a virtual aquatic playground: Kayakers glide toward pockets of wildlife, fishers cast for migrating Chinook salmon and swimmers splash near the banks.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t always so. &#8220;We had some pretty low points near the end of the 20th century,&#8221; says Suzi Cloutier, the water quality program coordinator at <a title="Willamette Riverkeeper" href="http://www.willamette-riverkeeper.org/WRK/index.html" target="_blank">Willamette Riverkeeper</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to safeguarding the river&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>But cleanup efforts and the city&#8217;s &#8220;Big Pipe,&#8221; a $1.4 billion project completed in 2011 that diverts runoff, have paid big dividends. &#8220;I see beaver, otter, even deer swimming across,&#8221; says Cloutier. &#8220;It&#8217;s cleaner than people can imagine.&#8221;</p>
<p>To experience the Willamette&#8217;s resurgent vitality close-up, head to <a title="Alder Creek Kayak, Canoe, Raft &amp; SUP" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/alder-creek-kayak-canoe-raft-sup/">Alder Creek</a>, under the Hawthorne Bridge, which offers stand-up paddleboarding (SUP), kayaking and canoeing lessons. Guided tours also visit waters near <a title="Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/oaks-bottom-wildlife-refuge/">Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge</a>, a haven for more than 100 species of birds.</p>
<p>You can practice your backstroke, too, thanks in part to the <a title="Human Access Project" href="http://www.humanaccessproject.com/" target="_blank">Human Access Project</a>, a nonprofit that creates beaches, cleans up shorelines and paves pathways to the river, like the sandy strip at <a title="Human Access Project: Swimming" href="http://www.humanaccessproject.com/swimming" target="_blank">Poet&#8217;s Beach</a>, found underneath the Marquam Bridge.</p>
<p>For an abridged tour, travel the river at breakneck speeds with <a title="Willamette Jetboat Excursions" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/willamette-jetboat-excursions-llc/">Willamette Jetboat Excursions</a>, whose 1,000-horsepower vessels perform figure eights from OMSI to Willamette Falls, soaking passengers along the way.</p>
<p>But no river outing celebrates the Willamette like <a title="The Big Float" href="http://www.travelportland.com/article/the-big-float/">The Big Float</a>. Each July, the splash part attracts upward of 2,000 inner-tubers for a lazy day on the river, complete with a music barge, food carts and a beer garden. The event is a floating billboard declaring it&#8217;s not only safe to go in the water — it&#8217;s also a blast.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>On Sept. 12, 2015, Bridgetown officially welcomes its latest addition: Tilikum Crossing. The bridge links the city&#8217;s South Waterfront, home to an Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU) campus and the Portland Aerial Tram, to the burgeoning <a title="Central Eastside" href="http://www.travelportland.com/collection/central-eastside/">Central Eastside</a>, known for visitor favorites like the Eastbank Esplanade and <a title="Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI)" href="http://www.travelportland.com/article/omsi/">Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI)</a>, plus some of the city&#8217;s best <a title="Central Eastside dining" href="http://www.travelportland.com/article/central-eastside-dining/">dining</a> and <a title="Central Eastside activities" href="http://www.travelportland.com/article/central-eastside-activities/">nightlife</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from its striking design, this cable-stayed bridge spanning the Willamette River has the distinction of being the only bridge in the country dedicated to light rail, buses, bicycles and pedestrians — without automobile traffic. <a title="MAX Light Rail" href="http://www.travelportland.com/article/max-light-rail/">MAX light rail trains</a> will run along the new 7.3-mile (11.7 km) <a title="MAX Orange Line" href="http://trimet.org/orangeline/" target="_blank">Orange Line</a> to the southeast suburb of Milwaukie, and the <a title="Portland Streetcar" href="http://www.travelportland.com/article/portland-streetcar/">Portland Streetcar</a> will complete its CL (Central Loop) Line connecting the major city-center neighborhoods.</p>
<p>With a pair of wide paths, the span offer pedestrians and cyclists ample room to slow down and appreciate its carefully considered details: Angles formed by the cables mirror the outline of Mount Hood, which rises in the background. (The angle is repeated elsewhere, including atop the tower pylons.) &#8220;Tilikum&#8221; means &#8220;people&#8221; in a local Native American language, hence the nickname &#8220;Bridge of the People.&#8221; There are nods to nature, too, with osprey nesting poles at either end and a &#8220;sonic dish&#8221; art installation on the east bank that amplifies the sounds of the river.</p>
<p>Even from afar the bridge stands out. LEDs light up the entire bridge, changing color and pattern based on how fast, deep and cold the river is flowing, making the crossing a true people-pleaser from any angle.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>A landmark on Portland’s east side for more than a century, the redbrick-walled Washington High School sat vacant for three decades. But now, a massive overhaul has restored the school’s status as a class act: The venerable institution has been transformed into one of the city’s top destinations for live entertainment.</p>
<p>At the heart of the remodel is <a title="Revolution Hall" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/revolution-hall/">Revolution Hall</a>, an 830-seat venue set inside the high school’s original auditorium. Vintage character abounds, with a full wraparound balcony and wooden chairs providing a great setting for an amped-up sound system — and top-notch performers.</p>
<p>Booked by the duo behind favorite eastside venues <a title="Mississippi Studios &amp; Bar Bar" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/mississippi-studios-bar-bar/">Mississippi Studios</a> and the <a title="Aladdin Theater" href="http://www.travelportland.com/directory/aladdin-theater/">Aladdin Theater</a>, Rev Hall opened in April 2015 with performances from Neko Case and the von Trapps, and it promises a steady lineup of local and touring indie rock, folk and pop acts. Summer 2015 shows include pop-folk duo The Weepies and beloved Portland soul singer Ural Thomas with his band, the Pain.</p>
<p>The hall’s offerings extend to stand-up comedy and lectures, and it’s also the new home of <a title="Live Wire Radio" href="http://www.travelportland.com/article/live-wire-radio/">Live Wire! Radio</a>, a variety show recorded twice monthly and broadcast across the U.S. The live tapings feature two back-to-back, hour-long shows packed with great live music, comedy and interviews with authors and other interesting people.</p>
<p>As it happens, two students of the former high school would have made great Live Wire! guests: Food luminary James Beard and Nobel Prize-winning chemist Linus Pauling both attended Washington High School. Yet another reason to consider heading back to school — at least for the night — in Portland.</p>
